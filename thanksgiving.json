Being from California near the coast, I fucking love oysters/scallops/clams and such, so when she brought it up we were both like \"oooohhhh, we like seafood! Can we get those??\". She giggled when we said \"seafood\". And she asked if we had ever heard of Rocky mountain oysters to which we replied that, no we had not. Her immediate response was \"ok, let's get you boys some oysters...\" with a big smile, jumping at the opportunity to trick her sister's two teenage males into eating testicles... thanks Aunty. \nSitting there at the table waiting I was wondering where they would even get oysters from in Colorado. I just kinda figured there was some big ass lake in the Rockies where they grew them or something... I didn't think much of it until the plate showed up with what *appeared* to be breaded potato chips or some shit with a side of fries. My first thought, was \"wwwwhat the fuck is this...?\".  They were seriously like large potato chip shaped, soft beef jerky with a chicken finger bread coating on the outside. I picked one up and examined it, then looked past it at my Aunt who just looked wayyy to excited at that moment, so I asked her \"what kind of oyster is *this*??\". Her I don't know just eat it response made me a little suspicious, so I just nibbled the corner a little bit at first and watched her...  she was like, TOO happy at that moment... she said \"... just *eat* it...\" but her face looked like that Jack Nicholson gif of him nodding his head. So I did. I chomped that testicle like it was a fucking chicken strip, because as far as I knew it *was* a chicken strip, like, maybe they messed up my order. And honestly, they're pretty damn good. They'd be amazing with some barbeque dipping sauce.  She didn't tell us until afterwards that we ate nuts and we just looked at each other and I was like \"fuck...\" and he was like \"seriously...\"  and that was that.  \n\nOverall: 7/10 would eat them again although never tell anyone about it.

He brought a some store bought chili.\n\n* **California**: the cousin that brought some huevos rancheros which looks a little old. All he does is talk about the band he's in and complain about the turkey being too dry.\n\n* **Colorado**: he brought in a disconcerting looking pie made from what looked like marshmallow fluff, half a large pretzel, and topped with cool ranch Doritos. Most likely something he invented when he was high.\n\n* **Connecticut**: the rich grandpa who remained quiet throughout the entire meal, at least until they popped open the 1964 bottle of wine he brought.\n\n* **Delaware**: the great grandmother who was starting to succumb to the effects of old age, however, that doesn't stop her from making a nice coleslaw.\n\n* **Florida**: the homeless guy you generously invited to dine with. You came to regret that decision when he started spouting off conspiracy theories and racial slurs. He brought nothing but some old cigarette butts, but left with some of the silverware.\n\n* **Georgia**: the kind old uncle who brought in some sweet tea he brewed that day.\n\n* **Hawaii**: always a cheerful one, he brought in some spam made with pineapple sauce. Unfortunately his joyous nature turned sour when Alabama accidentally told him he was adopted after drinking a little too much.\n\n* **Idaho**: the cousin who quit school in 7th grade, now living off the land. He brought in some baked potatoes, which smelled suspiciously of cigarettes.\n\n* **Illinois**: the fat uncle who brought in a deep dish pizza the size of a car tire. \n\n* **Indiana**: that one cousin who didn't talk at all and seemed extremely uncomfortable throughout the entire dinner. All he brought was his sadness.\n\n* **Iowa**: the great uncle suffering from dementia, he forgot everyone's names and kept repeating the same story about \"the barn incident\" from when he was 10.

            "My brother and I got tricked by my Aunt when we were visiting in Colorado into eating Rocky mountain oysters when we were about 14.  Being from California near the coast, I fucking love oysters/scallops/clams and such, so when she brought it up we were both like \"oooohhhh, we like seafood! Can we get those??\". She giggled when we said \"seafood\". And she asked if we had ever heard of Rocky mountain oysters to which we replied that, no we had not. Her immediate response was \"ok, let's get you boys some oysters...\" with a big smile, jumping at the opportunity to trick her sister's two teenage males into eating testicles... thanks Aunty. \nSitting there at the table waiting I was wondering where they would even get oysters from in Colorado. I just kinda figured there was some big ass lake in the Rockies where they grew them or something... I didn't think much of it until the plate showed up with what *appeared* to be breaded potato chips or some shit with a side of fries. My first thought, was \"wwwwhat the fuck is this...?\".  They were seriously like large potato chip shaped, soft beef jerky with a chicken finger bread coating on the outside. I picked one up and examined it, then looked past it at my Aunt who just looked wayyy to excited at that moment, so I asked her \"what kind of oyster is *this*??\". Her I don't know just eat it response made me a little suspicious, so I just nibbled the corner a little bit at first and watched her...  she was like, TOO happy at that moment... she said \"... just *eat* it...\" but her face looked like that Jack Nicholson gif of him nodding his head. So I did. I chomped that testicle like it was a fucking chicken strip, because as far as I knew it *was* a chicken strip, like, maybe they messed up my order. And honestly, they're pretty damn good. They'd be amazing with some barbeque dipping sauce.  She didn't tell us until afterwards that we ate nuts and we just looked at each other and I was like \"fuck...\" and he was like \"seriously...\"  and that was that.  \n\nOverall: 7/10 would eat them again although never tell anyone about it. And never eat them at the same restaurant twice ",

For a moment, I became a fire breathing dragon with flames that could burnanate a whole town. Then it reeked havoc on my butthole later. Shit was hot, yo. \n\nAnyway, that's all I remember from my trip there. If I ever go back, I will have no peppers. The breakfast was pretty tasty, though."

He brought nothing but some old cigarette butts, but left with some of the silverware.\n\n* **Georgia**: the kind old uncle who brought in some sweet tea he brewed that day.\n\n* **Hawaii**: always a cheerful one, he brought in some spam made with pineapple sauce. Unfortunately his joyous nature turned sour when Alabama accidentally told him he was adopted after drinking a little too much.\n\n* **Idaho**: the cousin who quit school in 7th grade, now living off the land. He brought in some baked potatoes, which smelled suspiciously of cigarettes.\n\n* **Illinois**: the fat uncle who brought in a deep dish pizza the size of a car tire. \n\n* **Indiana**: that one cousin who didn't talk at all and seemed extremely uncomfortable throughout the entire dinner. All he brought was his sadness.\n\n* **Iowa**: the great uncle suffering from dementia, he forgot everyone's names and kept repeating the same story about \"the barn incident\" from when he was 10.

She brings venison meatloaf, but by the time she got to the dinner it was freezing cold\n\n* **Arizona**: the brother in law who couldn't help but open carry during the entire dinner and starts every sentence with \"As an American, I...\". He brought a some store bought chili.\n\n* **California**: the cousin that brought some huevos rancheros which looks a little old. All he does is talk about the band he's in and complain about the turkey being too dry.\n\n* **Colorado**: he brought in a disconcerting looking pie made from what looked like marshmallow fluff, half a large pretzel, and topped with cool ranch Doritos. Most likely something he invented when he was high.\n\n* **Connecticut**: the rich grandpa who remained quiet throughout the entire meal, at least until they popped open the 1964 bottle of wine he brought.\n\n* **Delaware**: the great grandmother who was starting to succumb to the effects of old age, however, that doesn't stop her from making a nice coleslaw.\n\n* **Florida**: the homeless guy you generously invited to dine with. You came to regret that decision when he started spouting off conspiracy theories and racial slurs. He brought nothing but some old cigarette butts, but left with some of the silverware.\n\n* **Georgia**: the kind old uncle who brought in some sweet tea he brewed that day.\n\n* **Hawaii**: always a cheerful one, he brought in some spam made with pineapple sauce. Unfortunately his joyous nature turned sour when Alabama accidentally told him he was adopted after drinking a little too much.\n\n* **Idaho**: the cousin who quit school in 7th grade, now living off the land. He brought in some baked potatoes, which smelled suspiciously of cigarettes.\n\n* **Illinois**: the fat uncle who brought in a deep dish pizza the size of a car tire. \n\n* **Indiana**: that one cousin who didn't talk at all and seemed extremely uncomfortable throughout the entire dinner. All he brought was his sadness.\n\n* **Iowa**: the great uncle suffering from dementia, he forgot everyone's names and kept repeating the same story about \"the barn incident\" from when he was 10.

She brings venison meatloaf, but by the time she got to the dinner it was freezing cold\n\n* **Arizona**: the brother in law who couldn't help but open carry during the entire dinner and starts every sentence with \"As an American, I...\". He brought a some store bought chili.\n\n* **California**: the cousin that brought some huevos rancheros which looks a little old. All he does is talk about the band he's in and complain about the turkey being too dry.\n\n* **Colorado**: he brought in a disconcerting looking pie made from what looked like marshmallow fluff, half a large pretzel, and topped with cool ranch Doritos. Most likely something he invented when he was high.\n\n* **Connecticut**: the rich grandpa who remained quiet throughout the entire meal, at least until they popped open the 1964 bottle of wine he brought.\n\n* **Delaware**: the great grandmother who was starting to succumb to the effects of old age, however, that doesn't stop her from making a nice coleslaw.\n\n* **Florida**: the homeless guy you generously invited to dine with. You came to regret that decision when he started spouting off conspiracy theories and racial slurs. He brought nothing but some old cigarette butts, but left with some of the silverware.\n\n* **Georgia**: the kind old uncle who brought in some sweet tea he brewed that day.\n\n* **Hawaii**: always a cheerful one, he brought in some spam made with pineapple sauce. Unfortunately his joyous nature turned sour when Alabama accidentally told him he was adopted after drinking a little too much.\n\n* **Idaho**: the cousin who quit school in 7th grade, now living off the land. He brought in some baked potatoes, which smelled suspiciously of cigarettes.\n\n* **Illinois**: the fat uncle who brought in a deep dish pizza the size of a car tire. \n\n* **Indiana**: that one cousin who didn't talk at all and seemed extremely uncomfortable throughout the entire dinner. All he brought was his sadness.\n\n* **Iowa**: the great uncle suffering from dementia, he forgot everyone's names and kept repeating the same story about \"the barn incident\" from when he was 10. He at least remembered to bring some brussel sprouts, although it would have helped if he remembered to cook them.\n\nI'm tired and lazy right now, so I'm going to nap for a bit, but ill finish the list if you guys want.",

Although, I live in PA now and scrapple is pretty prevalent, it just never occurred to me that it was a Pennsylvania thing.  I just assumed it was a north Jersey thing or a NYC thing.\n\nNinja: why'd you bring up scrapple in a pork roll thread anyways?"
