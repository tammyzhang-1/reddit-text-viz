            "At 19, I dropped out of college and moved to Oahu, where I became a live-in nanny for a dual military family. They had a beautiful house with their own private beach that I lived in for 2 years while I worked for them. And although the island\u2019s beauty took my breath away literally every day, living in Hawaii as a white person is not very ideal. And I couldn\u2019t imagine it if I were a man. The blatant racism and extremely high rates of homelessness and crime, was enough to make me want to move back home. The culture shock I experienced there as well was intense. Definitely don\u2019t regret the adventures I had there though and I look back fondly over a lot of memories I made while there. Maybe if I liked my job better I would also have enjoyed it more \ud83d\ude05",

Beautiful mountains and rainbows; whatever, shrug. That sort of amazing is everyday when you grow up here. It took me moving to Boston to really appreciate it.\n\nThen I moved home after college, and the reality sunk in. Everything is super expensive. No one pays what you are worth. I graduated in a top 10 program in my job field, and I was being offered less than half of my class average to work in Honolulu. \n\nI moved to Vegas, which was booming at the time. Typical, I know. I got a job within a month making 10% more than my class average. It was cheap living, more money, and lots of fun. But it wasn't home. \n\nHawaii is paradise, but it will tax you.",

            "You don\u2019t even need to be from there. Other people would say the best state is Colorado for mountains or Arizona for deserts or Hawaii for beaches. California has all that and more. Mountains may not be as high or the beaches as tropical, but it\u2019s all there. You can go skiing, hiking in the redwoods, and surfing within hours, and it has world class cuisine, diverse people and cultures, and is at the heart of the technology, agriculture, and entertainment industries. Massive cities and charming small towns. It\u2019s expensive. Overpriced even. But there\u2019s a reason, and that\u2019s the free market. The people have spoken.",
            "I\u2019m a teacher, and one thing you can count on every year is Hawaii public schools are always hiring and recruiting from the mainland. People often ask me why I\u2019ve never jumped at it, and I explain to the the combination of factors that lead to why **Hawaii public schools are always trying to hire from the mainland.**",

Still a damn beautiful place to be though. Lived there for a year before I couldn't afford it anymore, but I still visit my brother who lives there.\n\nHonolulu is just the LA of Hawaii. Maui is a little better than Oahu if you still want to feel like you're apart of a city and night life. Kauai though.. you go there to disconnect and be at peace. Mostly rural.. beautiful beaches and the most insanely gorgeous hikes you've ever been on. Only downfall is that there is just one highway that connects everything so the traffic can get sorta rough.",

            "I\u2019ve spent maybe two weeks total of my life in Hawaii, Oahu in June and Maui in February. I never felt too too hot for a minute. To me it seems a lot different than say living in Texas or Arizona in terms of too much heat.",
            "The secret is that the way Hawaii politics works is that the housing developers point toward the high homelessness and high housing costs as justifications for easing development regulations, then they go and build luxury housing that only foreign buyers can afford. \n\nIt\u2019s basically keep the local housing demand high by only supplying to foreign buyers.",
            "I lived in Honolulu for 2 1/2 years. It was amazing, and I was paying less in rent than I was in San Francisco. You want to pay less, you\u2019re going to live in a shithole. Pay more? Live in Hawaii baby. \n\nIf you think life is all dollars and cents, good luck and have a great time. I\u2019d rather live somewhere great.\n\nCurrently live in Marin, CA. Life is good :)",
            "I have the same response to people who think living in Hawaii is \"too expensive\"; just like any other place in the world you can find expensive choices or you can look for more frugal options. Just depends on your attitude. I don't even have a car so that is one less expense. I chose to skip the car and just live close to work. I chose to have roomies instead of paying for a studio, I choose to buy cheap groceries and make food rather than going out to expensive restaurants, I choose to drink filtered water instead of buying expensive options, you can find anything for any budget. I keep it simple so I can live in paradise, its literally 72 degrees and sunny in October and I've never been happier. Our society likes to \"keep up with the Jones'\", but I don't care about that stuff, I don't need a new Tesla, I dont need a big house with a white picket fence, I don't need the latest fashion or eat the new trendy wagyu meals or craft cocktails. I live for experiences and my ideal life, not for material possessions or for a job. I like people we are a cool species and I think when we work together we do the most amazing things. CA does need to improve their public transportation, but we're getting better and I really hope in the not too distant future we eliminate humans driving anyway; humans make far too many errors to be in control of multi ton vehicles. Hope we eventually travel like schools of fish in pods. Then people can do whatever on their commutes without having to worry about the mundane task of driving a car(which is such an outdated technology anyway). Well enjoy the day friends! One Love",

            "Had a coworker who went there for a 3 month job, surveying. Loved it for the first few months. Said that they got 'stuck on the rock' and couldn't afford to move back for many years. Hates Hawaii for that reason. Also ticked that, while his wife earned money as a server, the cost of living ate that up and there were no more surveying jobs on that island (he said). Must have been that island called, Moloka'i?  I don't know for sure how he got back to the mainland, but I'm pretty sure it was without his wife and belongings. Very bitter man. I think the place is best suited mostly for people of Hawaiian ancestry or tourists. I've known a few Hawaiian (ethnic) people over the years. Everyone (they'd say) thinks they're from Mexico! The totally wrong direction on the compass!",
            "I have no idea what Japan is like, but it's a lot different in Hawaii than mainland US is used to. Still probably a bit of culture shock for most Japanese.\n\nCost of living, people don't tolerate disrespect, pace of life, isolation, I mean 3000 miles from anything...\n\nI love it, but it's seriously just like home. I think most people don't make it more than a year or two it seems though.",
            "Retiring in Hawaii can mean LOTS of trips to California for medical specialists. We have friends going through this right now.",
            "Yup. I got a job offer in Hawaii. My gf and I moved there and, within 6 months, we were back on the mainland. It was beautiful and all but the isolation really freaked me out and I had to leave.",
            "Been in Hawaii for 15 years and I can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else. \nBut for everyone that might want to move here, yeah it\u2019s way too hot. And surfing sucks, don\u2019t try it. \ud83d\ude02",
            "Take it from someone who has lived in both Hawaii and Arizona. Hawaii is hotter. Arizona might get to 120 and be brutally hot for 3-4 months a year, but Hawaii is hot and humid all year long. In Arizona, you get respite for many months. The heat in Hawaii never stops. Even when it rains, it's still hot.",
            "The minimum income needed for 2 people to qualify for a market price condo is $250k/year.\n\nFor affordable housing in Hawaii you need a 2 person income of $106-136k/year.

            "The golf cart girls at the resort i was a manager for a while which wasn't in Hawaii were pulling in 100k+ a year.\n\nIt was a very fancy resort though, and very expensive to golf on it. Half the reason I started working there was because I learned employees can golf for free :)",
            "Also remember $80k in Hawaii isn't exactly great. Everything is expensive as shit, partially due to a stupid ass law called The Jones Act.\n\nIf your shop goes from a US port, to another US port, it has to be US owned, registered, crewed, and built.\n\nWhat this does is massively restricts shipping. And those companies who meet this law, charge a lot more, because fuck you that's why. If I'm a company in California and contract a Canadian ship to ship some stuff from Japan. I cannot have that ship stop in Hawaii and drop off supplies on the way.\n\nThat's illegal, because of a stupid ass law from 100 years ago that we temporarily repeal every time there's an emergency, because it's a bad law. It also increases our dependence on trucking, because I can't say order supplies from Europe, offload some in NYC, then some in Charlotte, then some in Tampa, and some in Houston.\n\nInstead they all have to be unloaded in NYC then trucked around the country. Making goods more expensive, with more emissions, more wear on our roads, and less safe.\n\nRepeal the Jones act.",
            "I thought living in California was expensive till I checked out Hawaii. Need to take out a second mortgage on your house if you want to fill up your tank.",
            "That's not a surprise to people living in Japan thinking about retiring in Hawaii. Japan is notoriously expensive to live in.",
            "There is a lot of Japanese That live in Hawaii, more than most people would think. There is a Japanese cemetery there. It has a Pagoda the monks are there, nice garden and Coy pond.That is where my SIL proposed to my daughter.",

Scraping by is $110k. \n\nComfortable is $200k\n\nBuying a home and actually living here as your home is $150k in cash you family left you and also making $200k a year minimum. \n\nIf youve got the cash and house figured our then yeah best place on earth. \n\nTruly good people. Happy place.",
            "Depends on which island actually. Not all of them are the same for economy within the state itself. Some islands 80k would be considered poverty as a living wage in Hawaii is 112k. But some islands are lower cost of living but also less pay so 80k would probably barely be a living wage on one of them",
            "Yeah 80k isn't a lot in Hawaii, until you compare it to teachers who a\u0155 making the lowest wages in the country at $47k.\n\nImagine going through college to teach keiki and they don't even give you a liveable wage.",
            "Right now gas on average is more expensive in CA, WA, and NV than Hawaii.",
            "Had everyone telling me how expensive it is. Again, from Alaska, so kinda used to it. \n\nI was offered an apartment for 850 and a few for 1250 a month. That's cheap as hell compared to what I'm used to. Had a ballin ass place offered for 1400, but I don't want to drive 40 minutes to and from work.\n\nI'm in LA for a minute, fucking gas prices here are worse. \n\nHawaii sucks though, wouldn't recommend living there.",
            "I'd agree with this. I'm staying in Hawaii for the week, and the Japanese culture is definitely prevalent. In fact, almost everywhere I've been, the signs in English are also all translated in Japanese. Granted, I'm in a tourist area.",

            "What is your source that $112k is a living wage in Hawaii?\n\nEdit: Nevermind I googled it and found it. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/single-people-hawaii-average-112-181124367.html\n\nLet me just say that this \u201cstudy\u201d from a personal finance website is ridiculous. It says a living wage in MA is $88k and in California is $80k. Even its lowest state, MS, requires $46k to have a living wage. How did they arrive at that number? \n\n\u201cGOBankingRates recently surveyed annual living expenses for a single person in each of the 50 states. The researchers used the 2021 Consumer Expenditure Survey data (the latest available) for a single person from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calculate the annual cost of necessities based on data from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center\u2019s 2023 Q1 Cost of Living Data Series.\n\nWith the cost of necessities in hand, researchers doubled the total annual cost of necessities to determine a living wage that also factors in discretionary spending and savings.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.gobankingrates.com/money/making-money/living-wage-single-person-needs-all-50-states/\n\nBasically it has arbitrarily assigned a living wage as double the cost of necessities which is higher than the median income. So now we are saying over half the people in this country don\u2019t earn a living wage and are living in poverty? I\u2019m sure some dummies will chime in with a \u201cyup\u201d but critical thinkers will recognize this is not true.",
            "No the living wage in Hawaii is not 112k and wherever you got that from lied to you.",
            "Yeah but good poverty, right? Like Hawaii, poverty, not Kentucky poverty.",
            "True but Hawaii isn\u2019t exactly the best place for it either. They don\u2019t help people at all really and have a very large homeless population. A lot of people that are homeless or poor there can\u2019t even leave because it\u2019s too expensive to leave.",

The only cons are hard winters and somewhat rude people-if you aren\u2019t accustomed to it. The pros are myriad. The people there are well-educated, highly cultured, competent and responsible. They have great, varied seasons, beautiful falls, pleasant summers. The cities are quaint, clean and progressive. The people are generally affluent outside of a few very destitute Trump towns. The governments are well run and funded, and the states work effectively. They have fantastic educational institutions, pretty mountains, nice shoreline. They very rarely experience natural disasters and are extremely stable regions. When one thinks of \u201cclassic USA\u201d these states and their style come to mind. I\u2019m sure naysayers will jump in with examples of problems with these states- but those issues are microscopic compared to states like Mississippi and Tennessee. Yikes, filled with poor stupid people, ugly weather and natural disasters galore and so on.\nThe other states that are being claimed have too many issues.

            "Hard to sum up my life in a quick little response like this, but I can try.\n\n1. Colorado, State I grew up in, absolutely beautiful, love the proximity to the mountains in the two cities I lived in (Loveland and Colorado Springs). You can be having a hot day in the city, drive 30-45 minutes and be up in the mountains where the temperature is cooler, and the scenery is spectacular. Main reason I don't live there currently is that it seems like everyone agrees with me on my first point. Roads going into the mountains can be very crowded, as everyone likes to take advantage of those recreation opportunities, so if you like to hunt and fish, like I do, and you don't own your own land to hunt, you will be sharing public land with everyone else, and it can get \"crowded\". Not really crowded in the traditional sense, but it doesn't take very many hunters to make a place crowded for hunting. Also, as it's such a popular State to move to, housing is getting more expensive than local salaries really allow, of course this is getting to be a problem everywhere, but especially in CO.\n2. Manitoba, my parents moved my family here from Colorado when I was 16, they bought a hunting and fishing outfitting business in a remote area, about one hour's drive from the nearest town big enough to have a Canadian Tire. Four hours from Winnipeg. As a kid in high school, going from a majority-white school in Colorado to a majority Aboriginal school in rural Manitoba, this was a huge cultural shift for me. I had a hard time making friends and relating to the local kids, but I really enjoyed my time with my family, as my parents were now working together at home instead of commuting to office jobs. We did guided bear hunts, waterfowl, and fishing. Heated our house mostly with a wood stove, in buildings from the 1950's that weren't lived in year-round before we moved there, it was a huge adventure, but ultimately, the lack of job opportunities near my parents, the only real city in Manitoba being Winnipeg, which I wasn't fond of, and not wanting to pay for a work visa to stay in Canada as an 18-year-old, I moved back to the US and joined the US Army.\n3. Missouri and South Carolina I was only in for a short time as a trainee in the US Army, so I didn't see much outside of military bases. However, I will say that even in the middle of summer I enjoyed the climate in SC and MO, as a Colorado boy it was a little humid but I enjoyed the change of pace. Really don't feel qualified to comment on much else as I wasn't really living in the community.\n4. North Dakota, moved here for college after marrying a Canadian, we could be close to her family while I went to school. Really liked the ultra-low State taxes, cheap housing, and strong job market, but there's not much in the way of recreation opportunities unless your family owns private land that you have access to, or if you live in one of the bigger towns, Grand Forks, Bismark, or Fargo, and have a lot of indoor hobbies.\n5. Minnesota, came here for a job opportunity, live in one of the prettiest areas I ever have, Duluth, right by Lake Superior. The winters are intense, but we've embraced it snowmobiling, skiing, and spending time with friends. Summers here are absolutely beautiful, being by the big lake keeps us cooler, and there is lots of public land, parks, and even trails right though the city in the greenspace for hiking and mountain biking.  It feels like a greener, more lush Colorado in a lot of ways, (except for the cold) and because Minnesota is home to so many huge companies, 3M, Post cereal, General Mills, Target, United Healthcare, Land O Lakes, Hormel, Toro, US Bank, Best Buy, CHS, Polaris, Arctic Cat, and many more, we have a very well funded State government, which does a very admirable job (for the US, still not as generous as Canada) of taking care of it's citizens through healthcare, infrastructure, education, etc. Taxes are higher than ND, but so is the opportunity. Main thing I don't like is the weather in the winter can be really tough, and the salt on the roads eats cars over time, much worse than CO, and even a little worse than ND, they get a little less snow over there. It also takes a while to make friends in my particular town, I think just because it's smaller, there are more locals, and they don't always want more friends. Have to become part of a church, club, or foster friendships at work.\n\nHope that's somewhat helpful for you.",

            "I grew up in GR and live in the Lansing area now. Also spent a handful of years in the Flint area. GR and Flint are at about the same point latitude-wise (the 43rd parallel goes right through GR, if you want to get technical). Lansing is slightly south of that, and Detroit a bit more still, but we're talking a total span of about fifty miles north-to-south.\n\nGR is a really cool city. Lots of stuff to do. It's big enough (metro area population \\~1 million) that whatever you're looking for, you're likely to find it; you pretty much never have to drive to some other bigger city to find something unless it's ultra specific (e.g. if you want to go to the Detroit Zoo or the Shedd Aquarium, you'll need to drive to Detroit or Chicago, respectively), but it's small enough that property values are not insane, traffic is manageable, and it's easy to get pretty much anywhere you want to go. It has one of the more attractive downtown areas I've encountered.\n\nLansing is smaller (about half the metro area population), and once in a great while I need to drive to GR or metro Detroit to find what I need. The downtown area pales in comparison to GR, but we have a decent bit of fun stuff to do and good places to eat.

Lansing isn't, at least 99% of the time. After a typical winter storm, Grand Haven will have 18\" of snow, Grand Rapids will have 8-12, and Lansing will have 2-4.\n\nIt definitely gets cold here. Temperatures below 0\u00baF (-18C) happen a couple times each winter. Last winter there were a couple weeks where I don't think it got \\_above\\_ zero for about a month, and we saw temps as low as -15F. But for the most part, Winter temps hover in the 10-25 range. Cold, but manageable if you know how to dress for it. The cool thing about cold weather is that you can \\_always\\_ add more layers. If it's hot, once you're down to your birthday suit, you're out of options!\n\nThe biggest thing about winter is that you need to find something fun to do so that you don't hate it. My family are alpine (aka downhill) skiers. Skiing is great fun, and great exercise! Michigan isn't a skier's paradise like Colorado or anything, but there's definitely fun to be had, even in the southern part of the state. There are options, too: there's snowboarding, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, ice fishing, ice skating, ice hockey, snowball fights, snow-fort building, sledding.... Plus, there is a wonderful quietness about the world when it's covered in a blanket of snow, and the way everything sparkles on a sunny day after a snowstorm is straight up beautiful.\n\nIt gets hot here too. This past July, we had several days over 100\u00baF, and it's humid, too. Michigan has many thousands of inland lakes of varying sizes, and those provide tons of entertainment in the summer too. Waterskiing / wakeboarding, boating, fishing, kayaking, and all that kind of stuff. Great way to stay cool on those hot-hot days!",
            "The weather makes a big difference, but yes. Colorado is pretty but Denver as a city is bad imo",
            "Isn't that the town with the police department that shoots puppies and tazes  elderly Ladies with dementia? Don't want to give my tax money to Loveland Colorado",
            "Oh. You should come to California. Obviously, the mountains are a lot more impressive than Colorado.",
            "I'm not shy about why I moved away\n\nIt's aggressively gentrified. Public transit could have been a lot better. Food is average and meh but you pay big city prices for it. Most of the good food has either changed or disappeared over the last decade. Few to no direct international flights. It's highly *segregated*, not diverse. There's a difference.\n\nThere *is* culture, art, museums, exhibits there, but unfortunately, I was spoiled by Chicago growing up so it just simply doesn't compare.\n\nI personally don't partake in outdoor activities, but I've heard enough about the overwhelming congested traffic that I'm happy I don't do those activities. I assume you partake since that's often the biggest draw, but there are other outdoorsy places in this country where everyone around you isn't super mega crazy and intense and mean about it. \n\nRegardless of gender and sexuality, if you are looking to date men, it's rough. Colorado is one large playground so it attracts a lot of men who don't want to grow up or settle.\n\nThis is purely hypothetical,  but it wouldn't surprise me if we see a shift back to a purple or even red state for Colorado. A lot of individuals have moved there from more conservative areas of the nation and still bring a lot of conservative values with them.",
            "Thanks for the detailed response, I\u2019ve heard Colorado has gotten far busier in the past 15 years (especially post legalization). Definitely something I kept in mind while job surfing, though I still value being closer to the outdoors and it being crowded than being more than 2 hours from it living in east coast cities",
            "Yeah it\u2019s the same story everywhere. I live in Colorado and we specifically hate Texans",
            "I\u2019m from the southeast and that\u2019s one of my favorite parts about Colorado. Religion is NOT in your face here at all",
            "I'd be curious to hear which state you moved to (sounds like CA) to think CO has a Jesus problem. I'm from MO, lived in NC as well, and besides the Bible thumpers you see on CSU campus that all major campuses will attract, a Jesus problem doesn't even approach my radar of Colorado issues",
            "Unless you have friends or family here, don\u2019t lock yourself in to just Colorado.  There are some other cool places my wife and I were looking at when we moved back a few years ago.  Bellingham (WA), Hood River (OR), Boise (ID), Reno, and also Salt Lake City.",
            "You would be fully welcomed here in Colorado.",
            "Check out the Sierra from Sequoia to Yosemite. It\u2019s a tier above anything in Colorado, with bigger mountains, better forests, more biodiversity, more wilderness, bigger waterfalls, etc.   \nPlus, there\u2019s a lot more variety of mountainous scenery in CA.",
            "My dad lived in Colorado for years before I was born, and I will never understand why he moved to freaking *Oklahoma* of all places and now this is where we're at lmao. My wife and I are just saving to move, and CO is on the list of possible states. once we've narrowed that down, it's looking at where's the nicest and yet not wildly overpriced place to live.\n\nedit: nicest includes safest as well."

Next to Bisbee, we have Tombstone. Tombstone and Bisbee were both tough towns in the old west, but Tombstone is the champ for the paradigm of the outlaw.\n\nWe have massive caverns and caves - Kartchner and Colossal. \n\nWe have a nuclear missile silo that you can visit. We have an airplane graveyard full of famous dead birds, like Kennedy's Air Force One.\n\nWe have a big hole in the northern part of the state, that some people have heard about. We have a sunset crater and a meteor crater.\n\nWe have a massive liberal city - Tucson. We have the fifth largest city in America, that was once a republican stronghold, but is getting more and more purple - Phoenix.\n\nWe have arid desert. We have pine and snow covered mountains.

They have great, varied seasons, beautiful falls, pleasant summers. The cities are quaint, clean and progressive. The people are generally affluent outside of a few very destitute Trump towns. The governments are well run and funded, and the states work effectively. They have fantastic educational institutions, pretty mountains, nice shoreline. They very rarely experience natural disasters and are extremely stable regions. When one thinks of \u201cclassic USA\u201d these states and their style come to mind. I\u2019m sure naysayers will jump in with examples of problems with these states- but those issues are microscopic compared to states like Mississippi and Tennessee. Yikes, filled with poor stupid people, ugly weather and natural disasters galore and so on.\nThe other states that are being claimed have too many issues. California is overcrowded, obscenely expensive, and has tons of disasters, horrible crime in the cities, smog.

There\u2019s a reason why California is the most populated state and most visited state. It\u2019s where people naturally would rather be",

Even poor people are happier in California than the wealthy where you live. Can\u2019t blame them. Every state has its own problems.

My niece, who is brashly obnoxious at times, said we should go to the front and say we\u2019re from Texas, and they will let us cut.  I laughed and said \u201cnot a chance in hell.

I, too, have lived in several states, and once I landed in Maine, I knew I wasn't leaving. The water that comes from the tap is literally the best I've ever tasted. The air is crisp and clean.

I don't mind it now that I've been living in New england for most of my adult life, but moving from Texas to Maine was a *big* shock to my senses.

Maine at one point recently was both the oldest *and* whitest state in the country, so very few people actually had any exposure and stereotypes were all most people knew.  That in turn makes it more difficult for POC to want to move to Maine.  Well, that and the lack of jobs and opportunity in general.  And of course there's just your straight up racism, but I don't think Maine is really *worse* in that regard than most other states.  Most racism here tends towards outright ignorance which can be corrected with exposure to other cultures.\n\nOne of my grandfathers sort of encapsulated the ignorant racism for me when I was a little kid in the early eighties.  He was on his 3rd rum and coke at about ten in the morning, and we were watching a rerun of \"The Price is Right,\" and a black man had just won a big prize.  He looks over at me and says (and forgive my language for a sec please) \"I fought with them n***ers over in Korea, and they're just as good as anyone else!\"\n\nSet his drink down, and just kept watching.  Is it good?  No, but it shows exposure can shine a light that many people can see.  Maine *is* getting more diverse, but slowly.",

Winters aren't always like that, but it is cold for around 6 months out of the year. Summer and fall makes it worth it, imo but I can see why someone wouldn't want to deal with the cold.",

            "But you were trying to imply guns are bad in your original comment. Surely if they're so evil like you think because you're terrified of them, then Maine would be like Mad Max considering the amount of them."

I'll take the humidity and jump in the pool over having to deal with freezing cold. Tampa Bay is great and I'm so happy I moved here. Great beaches and sunsets. Best airport I've been to. Easy to hop on a cruise ship for a cheap vacation. Good sports teams. I was just at Busch Gardens today which is a solid zoo/theme park. Bigger theme parks are close as well. Hurricanes never really hit hard here and the rain comes and goes quickly. I guess the takeaway is it depends on what you like, but people do want to retire here for a reason.",
            "Ah, my friend, let me tell you of a place that many people do not know exists: the desert of Washington.  Tumbleweeds, dust storms, high winds, brush fires, regular 100+ degree temps in the summer... as soon as you cross the cascades heading east, you begin to see yellow cheat grass around the bottom of the evergreen pines and firs that everyone thinks about when they think of WA. As you make your way towards Yakima you notice that the trees become less and less. By the time you reach Prosser, there are almost no naturally growing trees and they have been replaced by sage brush. Continue on that path for another 30 miles or so and you reach the Tri-Cities (or as the locals affectionately refer to it: the Dry-Shitties). If you have money, it is great - It's only good if you dont. This is where the Snake,  Yakima, and Columbia rivers converge yielding great fishing for salmon, trout, SMB, steelhead, walleye, and sturgeon. There is plenty of water space for wakeboarding, jet skiing, and whatever else you could dream of doing on the water.\n\n This place sits centrally located with several ski slopes within a 3 hour drive. Arguably Bluewood has some of the best snow in the country (I'll argue that to my death). If shitty weather is forecasted for Dayton/Bluewood, no worries, just head the other direction to the subpar snow of White Pass. Feeling like going a different route? Go south to Anthony Lakes (Oregon) or North to 49. \n\nAre you more of an offroad vehicle type? Free (at least the last time i was there) motocross track riding is available at Horn Rapids. Horn Rapids also houses a sprint boat track, kart track, ATV track, BMX track, and im sure more now. There are several public land riding spots nearby too if you want sand. The Juniper sand dunes and Moses Hole will keep you entertained. There used to be one of the best and most meticulously maintained motocross/supercross tracks i have ever ridden at ToesMXP, but i think they may have closed.\n\nI lived there up until 2009, and have since lived in Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, and Virginia and realize now how spoiled I was growing up there. The cost of living has absolutely exploded though. My mom bought her new construction home in 1994 for $70k (1300sf, 1/4 acre, 3br/2ba), and a house on the next street over is currently pending sale for $360k. Gas prices flirt with $5/gal. The last time i was there was 2019, and I will say that it is not the same tri cities that i grew up in, but it's still a pretty great place if you can get past the gang violence and not focus on the negatives.",

That literally ruins the state.\n\n>as far as the landscape in the weather and wildlife and access to national Parks in every direction? Unbeatable\n\nOregon, Washington, and BC are right there.

Assuming you\u2019re still going off the \u201chotter than hell\u201d thing, I\u2019m pretty sure all those other states except maybe Washington have more days over 100 degrees than NC. Also you get used to the heat pretty quick, and if it truly is too hot on any given day you can just drive to the best beaches in the US or one of the many lakes or head to the mountains to cool off. Being right in the center of the US latitude wise helps significantly with not being way too cold in the winter and not being way too hot in the summer.",
            "Did you try Austin?\nThey do have the highest speed limit in the nation (75mph) that's a fact.\nWashington has rainy weather which I don't like.

In Oregon these people ask how my day is and I feel like they care. I say \u201cMidwest people are nice, but West Coast folks are kind.\u201d Plus I love weed and mushrooms and being outdoors. Cali is cool too, but I\u2019ll tip my hat to Oregon.",

I LOVE the redwoods, I marvel at the central coast. Joshua tree is magical, Idyllwild is stunning. I grew up in San Diego and had no idea just how spoiled I was until I moved away. \n\nOregon is my new home now, and I find it just as entrancing but for different reasons. \n\nI still haven't done Yosemite, though. That's my next big trip!",

We don't usually go there to sunbathe and take a dip. We go to appreciate the beauty and the small coastal towns. A walk on the beach is more of a meditative experience in Oregon.",

            "I haven\u2019t spent much time in rural Oregon. I believe though. Portland folks weren\u2019t as friendly as other more populated areas, but certainly not angry racists. I was dumbfounded when I moved to a \u201cquaint\u201d small town in Wisconsin and how openly bigoted they were. I was expecting farmers asking me to help pull their tractor from the ditch and little old ladies in plaid aprons putting pies on the window sill. But I got Monster Energy Skidoo Fox racing small minded white supremacists. I made it about a year and legit didn\u2019t make one friend. I\u2019d go to one of the 3 bars in town and got a lot of \u201cYou ain\u2019t from around here boy\u201d type of attitude. I can see this in just about any small town in the US. It\u2019s super depressing. I truly wonder if it\u2019s always been like this and I never was exposed to it, or if it\u2019s just getting worse.",
            "Lol as someone from Oregon and lives in Texas, Spokane is fucking gorgeous.

            "I\u2019d would be interesting to see the data on that.  I\u2019ll preface this with i worked out of Mendocino County so i mostly went to Nor Cal fires. But in my experience, I probably went to the most fires in Lake County, Glenn/Butte, and spent a lot of time on the Oregon border in Del Norte. When I Igor sent to So Cal, I feel like it was riverside and San Bernardino. \n\nMono and Inyo would probably be my least visited.",
            "They are beautiful\u2026but as a Washingtonian I must say that Oregon has us beat in the wild NW beaches department.",
            "Ah, my friend, let me tell you of a place that many people do not know exists: the desert of Washington.  Tumbleweeds, dust storms, high winds, brush fires, regular 100+ degree temps in the summer... as soon as you cross the cascades heading east, you begin to see yellow cheat grass around the bottom of the evergreen pines and firs that everyone thinks about when they think of WA. As you make your way towards Yakima you notice that the trees become less and less. By the time you reach Prosser, there are almost no naturally growing trees and they have been replaced by sage brush. Continue on that path for another 30 miles or so and you reach the Tri-Cities (or as the locals affectionately refer to it: the Dry-Shitties). If you have money, it is great - It's only good if you dont. This is where the Snake,  Yakima, and Columbia rivers converge yielding great fishing for salmon, trout, SMB, steelhead, walleye, and sturgeon. There is plenty of water space for wakeboarding, jet skiing, and whatever else you could dream of doing on the water.\n\n This place sits centrally located with several ski slopes within a 3 hour drive. Arguably Bluewood has some of the best snow in the country (I'll argue that to my death). If shitty weather is forecasted for Dayton/Bluewood, no worries, just head the other direction to the subpar snow of White Pass. Feeling like going a different route? Go south to Anthony Lakes (Oregon) or North to 49. \n\nAre you more of an offroad vehicle type? Free (at least the last time i was there) motocross track riding is available at Horn Rapids. Horn Rapids also houses a sprint boat track, kart track, ATV track, BMX track, and im sure more now. There are several public land riding spots nearby too if you want sand. The Juniper sand dunes and Moses Hole will keep you entertained. There used to be one of the best and most meticulously maintained motocross/supercross tracks i have ever ridden at ToesMXP, but i think they may have closed.\n\nI lived there up until 2009, and have since lived in Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, and Virginia and realize now how spoiled I was growing up there. The cost of living has absolutely exploded though. My mom bought her new construction home in 1994 for $70k (1300sf, 1/4 acre, 3br/2ba), and a house on the next street over is currently pending sale for $360k. Gas prices flirt with $5/gal. The last time i was there was 2019, and I will say that it is not the same tri cities that i grew up in, but it's still a pretty great place if you can get past the gang violence and not focus on the negatives.",
            "> The problem with Idaho is the politics and the religion\n\nWHICH IS A HUGE PROBLEM. That literally ruins the state.\n\n>as far as the landscape in the weather and wildlife and access to national Parks in every direction? Unbeatable\n\nOregon, Washington, and BC are right there. You don't need idaho for any of that, it's certainly not unbeatable.",

            "I moved to small town Oregon from Louisiana and was SHOCKED to find more confederate flags on the back of trucks here than I did in LA. Like, they weren\u2019t even part of the war! The south argues (stupidly) that it\u2019s heritage over hate, but here all they can say is it\u2019s just hate.",

There\u2019s very little in the way of crowding. We don\u2019t have hurricanes, significant wildfires, or earthquakes. (We do get the occasional tornado, but they are pretty rare, only last a few minutes at most, and the damage is extremely focused when they happen.) We have no significant population of giant spiders, scorpions, poisonous snakes, fire ants, killer bees, sharks, alligators, crocodiles, or any other seriously troublesome wildlife. \n\nCalifornia is beautiful, but it\u2019s too expensive to live there and it takes too long to get places. Plus wildfires, droughts, and earthquakes. Also, oppressive regulations for hindering car modification as a hobby (it\u2019s one of mine). I\u2019m extremely left-leaning, but California as a whole is, IMO, the most centrist of the blue states.

            "Ah, my friend, let me tell you of a place that many people do not know exists: the desert of Washington.  Tumbleweeds, dust storms, high winds, brush fires, regular 100+ degree temps in the summer... as soon as you cross the cascades heading east, you begin to see yellow cheat grass around the bottom of the evergreen pines and firs that everyone thinks about when they think of WA. As you make your way towards Yakima you notice that the trees become less and less. By the time you reach Prosser, there are almost no naturally growing trees and they have been replaced by sage brush. Continue on that path for another 30 miles or so and you reach the Tri-Cities (or as the locals affectionately refer to it: the Dry-Shitties). If you have money, it is great - It's only good if you dont. This is where the Snake,  Yakima, and Columbia rivers converge yielding great fishing for salmon, trout, SMB, steelhead, walleye, and sturgeon. There is plenty of water space for wakeboarding, jet skiing, and whatever else you could dream of doing on the water.\n\n This place sits centrally located with several ski slopes within a 3 hour drive. Arguably Bluewood has some of the best snow in the country (I'll argue that to my death). If shitty weather is forecasted for Dayton/Bluewood, no worries, just head the other direction to the subpar snow of White Pass. Feeling like going a different route? Go south to Anthony Lakes (Oregon) or North to 49. \n\nAre you more of an offroad vehicle type? Free (at least the last time i was there) motocross track riding is available at Horn Rapids. Horn Rapids also houses a sprint boat track, kart track, ATV track, BMX track, and im sure more now. There are several public land riding spots nearby too if you want sand. The Juniper sand dunes and Moses Hole will keep you entertained. There used to be one of the best and most meticulously maintained motocross/supercross tracks i have ever ridden at ToesMXP, but i think they may have closed.\n\nI lived there up until 2009, and have since lived in Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, and Virginia and realize now how spoiled I was growing up there. The cost of living has absolutely exploded though. My mom bought her new construction home in 1994 for $70k (1300sf, 1/4 acre, 3br/2ba), and a house on the next street over is currently pending sale for $360k. Gas prices flirt with $5/gal. The last time i was there was 2019, and I will say that it is not the same tri cities that i grew up in, but it's still a pretty great place if you can get past the gang violence and not focus on the negatives.",

My skin dries out, I\u2019m freezing every morning, if it snows I have to battle through the elements on icy roads to get to work, if the temps go really low my pipes in my house will burst (has happened twice the past two years!!). \n\nIn all year round warm weather states all you need is hydration and sunscreen and you\u2019ll live.",

The people on the left value politics because they value the environment and quality of life for people who are marginalized. The right value politics because they think they are special snowflake edgelords keeping the status quo despite the fact they are indoctrinated in a cult that wishes to keep them down so that those in wealth and power remain that way.

They have great, varied seasons, beautiful falls, pleasant summers. The cities are quaint, clean and progressive. The people are generally affluent outside of a few very destitute Trump towns. The governments are well run and funded, and the states work effectively. They have fantastic educational institutions, pretty mountains, nice shoreline.

Tumbleweeds, dust storms, high winds, brush fires, regular 100+ degree temps in the summer... as soon as you cross the cascades heading east, you begin to see yellow cheat grass around the bottom of the evergreen pines and firs that everyone thinks about when they think of WA. As you make your way towards Yakima you notice that the trees become less and less. By the time you reach Prosser, there are almost no naturally growing trees and they have been replaced by sage brush. Continue on that path for another 30 miles or so and you reach the Tri-Cities (or as the locals affectionately refer to it: the Dry-Shitties). If you have money, it is great - It's only good if you dont. This is where the Snake,  Yakima, and Columbia rivers converge yielding great fishing for salmon, trout, SMB, steelhead, walleye, and sturgeon. There is plenty of water space for wakeboarding, jet skiing, and whatever else you could dream of doing on the water.\n\n This place sits centrally located with several ski slopes within a 3 hour drive. Arguably Bluewood has some of the best snow in the country (I'll argue that to my death). If shitty weather is forecasted for Dayton/Bluewood, no worries, just head the other direction to the subpar snow of White Pass. Feeling like going a different route? Go south to Anthony Lakes (Oregon) or North to 49. \n\nAre you more of an offroad vehicle type? Free (at least the last time i was there) motocross track riding is available at Horn Rapids. Horn Rapids also houses a sprint boat track, kart track, ATV track, BMX track, and im sure more now. There are several public land riding spots nearby too if you want sand. The Juniper sand dunes and Moses Hole will keep you entertained. There used to be one of the best and most meticulously maintained motocross/supercross tracks i have ever ridden at ToesMXP, but i think they may have closed.\n\nI lived there up until 2009, and have since lived in Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, and Virginia and realize now how spoiled I was growing up there. The cost of living has absolutely exploded though. My mom bought her new construction home in 1994 for $70k (1300sf, 1/4 acre, 3br/2ba), and a house on the next street over is currently pending sale for $360k. Gas prices flirt with $5/gal. The last time i was there was 2019, and I will say that it is not the same tri cities that i grew up in, but it's still a pretty great place if you can get past the gang violence and not focus on the negatives.",

If you like the city, Detroit and the metro area rocks, if you like the outdoors we have huge beautiful forests and more beautiful shoreline than almost any other state in the country! Also I will give a shout out to the Upper Peninsula which is pure God's country!",

            "Michigan and WV are my two favorite places. \n\nMichigan has a lot to offer and is relatively affordable. There\u2019s cities if you like that type of lifestyle. There\u2019s lots of wilderness if you like that. If you like both, even better. And more activities come and go as the seasons change. \n\nBut flint still doesn\u2019t have clean drinking water so that sucks. \n\nWV might throw people off. To me it\u2019s a beautiful state with a lot to offer. A lot of people judge it by it\u2019s stereotypes but I lived there for three years and regret nothing. I met some of the nicest and most interesting people there. And depending on where you live you get access to cities and wilderness. And it\u2019s cheap AF to live there. \n\nIt has its demons (politically and socially) but I swear it\u2019s a diamond in the rough if people would give it a chance. \n\nIf you can\u2019t tell I really like a balance between city and wilderness.",

            "Michigan. It\u2019s not perfect, but I love it. It\u2019s beautiful. Fresh water is more plentiful here than anywhere else in the world. We\u2019re at no risk of sea level rise. There\u2019s very little in the way of crowding. We don\u2019t have hurricanes, significant wildfires, or earthquakes. (We do get the occasional tornado, but they are pretty rare, only last a few minutes at most, and the damage is extremely focused when they happen.) We have no significant population of giant spiders, scorpions, poisonous snakes, fire ants, killer bees, sharks, alligators, crocodiles, or any other seriously troublesome wildlife. \n\nCalifornia is beautiful, but it\u2019s too expensive to live there and it takes too long to get places. Plus wildfires, droughts, and earthquakes. Also, oppressive regulations for hindering car modification as a hobby (it\u2019s one of mine). I\u2019m extremely left-leaning, but California as a whole is, IMO, the most centrist of the blue states. Then there\u2019s rampant homelessness\u2026.\n\nFlorida is also beautiful, but between the retirees, the crazy Trump supporters, Governor Ronda, the hurricanes, and the threat of sea level rise, I\u2019ll stick with just visiting. \n\nThere are lots of cool and interesting places on the East coast, but they\u2019re all too crowded IMO.",

Yeah, it sucks here, but it sucks everywhere, and it's not as bad as everybody says. Our state is so awesome it's split in 2 because it couldn't contain all the awesomeness.",
            "I\u2019ve lived in Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, California, and Oregon\n\nMost beautiful state is Oregon. Best state overall though is Nevada, although I lived in Las Vegas which is quite different than other parts of Nevada.

Tired of the fascism and racism going on down in the south, I\u2019ll even include Indiana and Ohio in there. Then move your ass to Michigan, where actual freedom still exists.

            "As someone who lived in South East Michigan last 30+ years. You can see snow fall from December through April. It usually doesn't stick to the ground till january/February. I remember still having snow pile leftovers in large parking lot in June melting from previous winter. Recent years there have been less and less heavy snow falls. We might get 12+ inches snow falls once or twice a winter. The most amazing thing is that snow gets removed from roads the same day, snow management is really good in metro detroit.\n\nNorthern Michigan is a different planet. There you can experience snow 7 months out of a year and it's usually measured in feet not inches.",
            "Early December through mid-March is the least desirable time to live in Michigan but the weather has been significantly milder with each increasing year. \n\nIf you live anywhere near MI, now is one of the best times to visit. Fall in Michigan is simply the best.",
            "Depends on where you live. The west side of the state has much harsher winters because of lake effect snow. The east side no so much. But the farther north you go, the longer it\u2019ll be. I grew up in southeast Michigan and you\u2019re looking December-March but that doesn\u2019t guarantee constant snow on the ground. On an odd year, the snow could bleed into April but it\u2019s unlikely. January-mid-March are the heaviest for snowfall",
            "My own take on that is people that don't like Michigan often complain that it's the winters here they don't like! Wisconsin and Minnesota both have colder more snow and icy winters than Michigan! Also, you could say the love of automobiles and popular music is almost like a religion in the modern western world! With Motown music and all the other gigantic music talents that have come out of Detroit and Michigan and the fact that Detroit and Michigan put this nation into automobiles sets this state apart in a very unique way! Add on the fact that it's surrounded on 3 sides by some of the cleanest fresh water in the world sets it apart from the rest of the country!",

It gets cold definitely but that doesn't tend to stop the snowmobiles, skiing, ice fishing! I get it ,you don't like the cold, Michigan winters are not for you? Ditch the negative vibes and come here for the summer! Problem solved!",
            "Sorry you feel that way! I came back to the Detroit area in February after being on the road for several years! I believe Michigan is as beautiful if not more so than most of this country! I don't follow politics so that doesn't concern me! I hope you find what you're looking for!",

City or rural Michigan is a very beautiful state! It takes a certain rugged existence to live in the northern winters, it's definitely not for everyone! Spring ,summer and fall here is usually real good weather!  It probably very similar in Wisconsin and Minnesota as well! I'm sure Wisconsin and Minnesota have storied history's as well but cars and music history here in Michigan is a pretty hard bar to beat! That's a big part of why people visit Michigan and Detroit!",

Weeks out at a time? \n\nMaybe once a year after an insane storm the power might be out for a day or 2. And thats just because I live in the middle of nowhere. \n\nOnce in Kalamazoo the power was out for like 3 days but thats the most I have ever seen. And that storm was wild. Like 4 feet of snow overnight. \n\nCrazy but Michigan isn't some backwoods shithole. We even have internet! Wild!",

            "Michigan natives agree!",
            "I grew up in GR and live in the Lansing area now. Also spent a handful of years in the Flint area. GR and Flint are at about the same point latitude-wise (the 43rd parallel goes right through GR, if you want to get technical). Lansing is slightly south of that, and Detroit a bit more still, but we're talking a total span of about fifty miles north-to-south.\n\nGR is a really cool city. Lots of stuff to do. It's big enough (metro area population \\~1 million) that whatever you're looking for, you're likely to find it; you pretty much never have to drive to some other bigger city to find something unless it's ultra specific (e.g. if you want to go to the Detroit Zoo or the Shedd Aquarium, you'll need to drive to Detroit or Chicago, respectively), but it's small enough that property values are not insane, traffic is manageable, and it's easy to get pretty much anywhere you want to go. It has one of the more attractive downtown areas I've encountered.\n\nLansing is smaller (about half the metro area population), and once in a great while I need to drive to GR or metro Detroit to find what I need. The downtown area pales in comparison to GR, but we have a decent bit of fun stuff to do and good places to eat. Our idea of bad traffic would make most people fall down laughing (oh man, I'm going to be five minutes late! \ud83e\udd23). \n\nGrand Rapids is close enough to Lake Michigan that it gets some significant lake-effect snow. Lansing isn't, at least 99% of the time. After a typical winter storm, Grand Haven will have 18\" of snow, Grand Rapids will have 8-12, and Lansing will have 2-4.\n\nIt definitely gets cold here. Temperatures below 0\u00baF (-18C) happen a couple times each winter. Last winter there were a couple weeks where I don't think it got \\_above\\_ zero for about a month, and we saw temps as low as -15F. But for the most part, Winter temps hover in the 10-25 range. Cold, but manageable if you know how to dress for it. The cool thing about cold weather is that you can \\_always\\_ add more layers. If it's hot, once you're down to your birthday suit, you're out of options!\n\nThe biggest thing about winter is that you need to find something fun to do so that you don't hate it. My family are alpine (aka downhill) skiers. Skiing is great fun, and great exercise! Michigan isn't a skier's paradise like Colorado or anything, but there's definitely fun to be had, even in the southern part of the state. There are options, too: there's snowboarding, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, ice fishing, ice skating, ice hockey, snowball fights, snow-fort building, sledding.... Plus, there is a wonderful quietness about the world when it's covered in a blanket of snow, and the way everything sparkles on a sunny day after a snowstorm is straight up beautiful.\n\nIt gets hot here too. This past July, we had several days over 100\u00baF, and it's humid, too. Michigan has many thousands of inland lakes of varying sizes, and those provide tons of entertainment in the summer too. Waterskiing / wakeboarding, boating, fishing, kayaking, and all that kind of stuff. Great way to stay cool on those hot-hot days!",
            "That\u2019s a good question, GR is more west of Michigan and Lansing more south central if I\u2019m correct don\u2019t quote me though lol geography isn\u2019t my thing! I would consider both areas to be closer to Detroit in terms of winters than up north. Temperature wise i think they\u2019re all averaging around the same, but it does snow more in Grand Rapids compared to Detroit and Lansing. you get the lake effect in GR which means more snow. But Lansing will have a little more snow than Detroit, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a significant difference though. I have heard it rains more in GR and it\u2019s more cloudy/a bit less sunny compared to Detroit metro area. I\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about Grand Rapids though, and honestly it\u2019s worth having all 4 seasons. I feel like having the same season year round would make life too stagnant for me if that makes sense",

            "Hard to sum up my life in a quick little response like this, but I can try.\n\n1. Colorado, State I grew up in, absolutely beautiful, love the proximity to the mountains in the two cities I lived in (Loveland and Colorado Springs). You can be having a hot day in the city, drive 30-45 minutes and be up in the mountains where the temperature is cooler, and the scenery is spectacular. Main reason I don't live there currently is that it seems like everyone agrees with me on my first point. Roads going into the mountains can be very crowded, as everyone likes to take advantage of those recreation opportunities, so if you like to hunt and fish, like I do, and you don't own your own land to hunt, you will be sharing public land with everyone else, and it can get \"crowded\". Not really crowded in the traditional sense, but it doesn't take very many hunters to make a place crowded for hunting. Also, as it's such a popular State to move to, housing is getting more expensive than local salaries really allow, of course this is getting to be a problem everywhere, but especially in CO.\n2. Manitoba, my parents moved my family here from Colorado when I was 16, they bought a hunting and fishing outfitting business in a remote area, about one hour's drive from the nearest town big enough to have a Canadian Tire. Four hours from Winnipeg. As a kid in high school, going from a majority-white school in Colorado to a majority Aboriginal school in rural Manitoba, this was a huge cultural shift for me. I had a hard time making friends and relating to the local kids, but I really enjoyed my time with my family, as my parents were now working together at home instead of commuting to office jobs. We did guided bear hunts, waterfowl, and fishing. Heated our house mostly with a wood stove, in buildings from the 1950's that weren't lived in year-round before we moved there, it was a huge adventure, but ultimately, the lack of job opportunities near my parents, the only real city in Manitoba being Winnipeg, which I wasn't fond of, and not wanting to pay for a work visa to stay in Canada as an 18-year-old, I moved back to the US and joined the US Army.\n3. Missouri and South Carolina I was only in for a short time as a trainee in the US Army, so I didn't see much outside of military bases. However, I will say that even in the middle of summer I enjoyed the climate in SC and MO, as a Colorado boy it was a little humid but I enjoyed the change of pace. Really don't feel qualified to comment on much else as I wasn't really living in the community.\n4. North Dakota, moved here for college after marrying a Canadian, we could be close to her family while I went to school. Really liked the ultra-low State taxes, cheap housing, and strong job market, but there's not much in the way of recreation opportunities unless your family owns private land that you have access to, or if you live in one of the bigger towns, Grand Forks, Bismark, or Fargo, and have a lot of indoor hobbies.\n5. Minnesota, came here for a job opportunity, live in one of the prettiest areas I ever have, Duluth, right by Lake Superior. The winters are intense, but we've embraced it snowmobiling, skiing, and spending time with friends. Summers here are absolutely beautiful, being by the big lake keeps us cooler, and there is lots of public land, parks, and even trails right though the city in the greenspace for hiking and mountain biking.  It feels like a greener, more lush Colorado in a lot of ways, (except for the cold) and because Minnesota is home to so many huge companies, 3M, Post cereal, General Mills, Target, United Healthcare, Land O Lakes, Hormel, Toro, US Bank, Best Buy, CHS, Polaris, Arctic Cat, and many more, we have a very well funded State government, which does a very admirable job (for the US, still not as generous as Canada) of taking care of it's citizens through healthcare, infrastructure, education, etc. Taxes are higher than ND, but so is the opportunity. Main thing I don't like is the weather in the winter can be really tough, and the salt on the roads eats cars over time, much worse than CO, and even a little worse than ND, they get a little less snow over there. It also takes a while to make friends in my particular town, I think just because it's smaller, there are more locals, and they don't always want more friends. Have to become part of a church, club, or foster friendships at work.\n\nHope that's somewhat helpful for you.",

They have great, varied seasons, beautiful falls, pleasant summers. The cities are quaint, clean and progressive. The people are generally affluent outside of a few very destitute Trump towns. The governments are well run and funded, and the states work effectively. They have fantastic educational institutions, pretty mountains, nice shoreline.

They're nice and polite, but that's where the majority of interactions end. You have to *really* put yourself out there, over and over, and not be afraid of rejection if you want to have any kind of social life.\n\nMost vermonters have lived there for generations so they aren't interested in widening their social circle. It can be very lonely, especially in the winter. There's a culture of keeping to yourself and not bothering anyone, ever, for anything. Self-reliance is a big deal to vermonters.",

            "Listen to this person! I've lived in Vermont for the past 13 years and it used to be great but now it's nothing like what it was. I'm actually moving to North Carolina (but I'm 28 and there is NOTHING to do in Vermont comparatively to other parts of the country.) \n\nWages are atrocious in that state. I was a Union Pipefitter before and we make $32 an hour!!! For reference that same job in Boston makes $60 an hour!! Vermont is the 3rd highest C.O.L. state in the country! All the tourism spots/ industry are getting hit hard because no one can afford to live in these vacation towns so that's starting to suffer. Jay Peak went from 1500 employees to 300. \n\nIt's not even that safe anymore. You used to be able to walk around Burlington at night without a care now you run the risk of getting shot, stabbed, jumped or having your stuff stolen. Also, Vermont has a incredibly big opioid/drug problem and it's getting worse by the day. We're a pretty central hub, think about it; Boston is 4 Hours, NYC is 6 or so, Montreal is like 2.5-3. People stop here quickly, make their sales and bounce back home. \n\nAll states have their problems but Vermont used to be a hidden gem. I think the isolation of COVID really exposed it as this \"safe haven\" and it's still cheaper than living in Cali or NYC so people moved. Don't get me wrong it is a beautiful state and some pretty amazing people.",
            "Parts of it like around the Champlain area. Vermont is a very unique place in the country in that it is poor, rural, and liberal. But the wealth disparity between Massachusetts and Vermont is enormous. Western mass is rural and liberal but it is very wealthy in most of that part of the state. I will see some absolute mansions and real ritz there. Vermont driving away from the few population centers you more see mountain people making their own syrup in their hand built sugar shacks fired by maple off their own property. Man, I absolutely LOVE Vermont; there really isn't any other place like it. I'm considering moving there.",
            "I agree with this.  Connecticut can\u2019t seem to figure out what it is.  Is it urban?  Is it rural?  And agreed with having to go to so many stores for stuff.  Things are more money and I couldn\u2019t find a reason to justify why.  I lived in the eastern half of the state though\u2014I suspect I may have liked being in the western half more.\n\nAlso most of New England does not use plastic bags anymore.  New Hampshire still does, but I know for sure that Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Vermont do not.  New Jersey also does not use plastic bags.",

Colorado, State I grew up in, absolutely beautiful, love the proximity to the mountains in the two cities I lived in (Loveland and Colorado Springs). You can be having a hot day in the city, drive 30-45 minutes and be up in the mountains where the temperature is cooler, and the scenery is spectacular. Main reason I don't live there currently is that it seems like everyone agrees with me on my first point. Roads going into the mountains can be very crowded, as everyone likes to take advantage of those recreation opportunities, so if you like to hunt and fish, like I do, and you don't own your own land to hunt, you will be sharing public land with everyone else, and it can get \"crowded\". Not really crowded in the traditional sense, but it doesn't take very many hunters to make a place crowded for hunting. Also, as it's such a popular State to move to, housing is getting more expensive than local salaries really allow, of course this is getting to be a problem everywhere, but especially in CO.\n2. Manitoba, my parents moved my family here from Colorado when I was 16, they bought a hunting and fishing outfitting business in a remote area, about one hour's drive from the nearest town big enough to have a Canadian Tire. Four hours from Winnipeg. As a kid in high school, going from a majority-white school in Colorado to a majority Aboriginal school in rural Manitoba, this was a huge cultural shift for me. I had a hard time making friends and relating to the local kids, but I really enjoyed my time with my family, as my parents were now working together at home instead of commuting to office jobs. We did guided bear hunts, waterfowl, and fishing. Heated our house mostly with a wood stove, in buildings from the 1950's that weren't lived in year-round before we moved there, it was a huge adventure, but ultimately, the lack of job opportunities near my parents, the only real city in Manitoba being Winnipeg, which I wasn't fond of, and not wanting to pay for a work visa to stay in Canada as an 18-year-old, I moved back to the US and joined the US Army.\n3. Missouri and South Carolina I was only in for a short time as a trainee in the US Army, so I didn't see much outside of military bases. However, I will say that even in the middle of summer I enjoyed the climate in SC and MO, as a Colorado boy it was a little humid but I enjoyed the change of pace. Really don't feel qualified to comment on much else as I wasn't really living in the community.\n4. North Dakota, moved here for college after marrying a Canadian, we could be close to her family while I went to school. Really liked the ultra-low State taxes, cheap housing, and strong job market, but there's not much in the way of recreation opportunities unless your family owns private land that you have access to, or if you live in one of the bigger towns, Grand Forks, Bismark, or Fargo, and have a lot of indoor hobbies.\n5. Minnesota, came here for a job opportunity, live in one of the prettiest areas I ever have, Duluth, right by Lake Superior. The winters are intense, but we've embraced it snowmobiling, skiing, and spending time with friends. Summers here are absolutely beautiful, being by the big lake keeps us cooler, and there is lots of public land, parks, and even trails right though the city in the greenspace for hiking and mountain biking.  It feels like a greener, more lush Colorado in a lot of ways, (except for the cold) and because Minnesota is home to so many huge companies, 3M, Post cereal, General Mills, Target, United Healthcare, Land O Lakes, Hormel, Toro, US Bank, Best Buy, CHS, Polaris, Arctic Cat, and many more, we have a very well funded State government, which does a very admirable job (for the US, still not as generous as Canada) of taking care of it's citizens through healthcare, infrastructure, education, etc. Taxes are higher than ND, but so is the opportunity. Main thing I don't like is the weather in the winter can be really tough, and the salt on the roads eats cars over time, much worse than CO, and even a little worse than ND, they get a little less snow over there. It also takes a while to make friends in my particular town, I think just because it's smaller, there are more locals, and they don't always want more friends. Have to become part of a church, club, or foster friendships at work.\n\nHope that's somewhat helpful for you.",

It's fantasy and not reality.\n\nAdditionally the Senate is considered more powerful than the House, being able to do things like vote on Judicial appointments.\n\nBy 2040 if population trends continue 30% of the population will control 70% of the Senate.

They wanted them to be represented, but not giving direct control. \n\nI mean, in that case, why don't we vote for everything then including the justices, the government agencies, the cabinet, etc. \n\nDo I hate that North Dakota has the same power in the Senate as California while helping the country less than California does, yes, but it is so that mob rule isn't directly implemented."

Roads going into the mountains can be very crowded, as everyone likes to take advantage of those recreation opportunities, so if you like to hunt and fish, like I do, and you don't own your own land to hunt, you will be sharing public land with everyone else, and it can get \"crowded\". Not really crowded in the traditional sense, but it doesn't take very many hunters to make a place crowded for hunting. Also, as it's such a popular State to move to, housing is getting more expensive than local salaries really allow, of course this is getting to be a problem everywhere, but especially in CO.\n2. Manitoba, my parents moved my family here from Colorado when I was 16, they bought a hunting and fishing outfitting business in a remote area, about one hour's drive from the nearest town big enough to have a Canadian Tire. Four hours from Winnipeg. As a kid in high school, going from a majority-white school in Colorado to a majority Aboriginal school in rural Manitoba, this was a huge cultural shift for me. I had a hard time making friends and relating to the local kids, but I really enjoyed my time with my family, as my parents were now working together at home instead of commuting to office jobs. We did guided bear hunts, waterfowl, and fishing. Heated our house mostly with a wood stove, in buildings from the 1950's that weren't lived in year-round before we moved there, it was a huge adventure, but ultimately, the lack of job opportunities near my parents, the only real city in Manitoba being Winnipeg, which I wasn't fond of, and not wanting to pay for a work visa to stay in Canada as an 18-year-old, I moved back to the US and joined the US Army.\n3. Missouri and South Carolina I was only in for a short time as a trainee in the US Army, so I didn't see much outside of military bases. However, I will say that even in the middle of summer I enjoyed the climate in SC and MO, as a Colorado boy it was a little humid but I enjoyed the change of pace. Really don't feel qualified to comment on much else as I wasn't really living in the community.\n4. North Dakota, moved here for college after marrying a Canadian, we could be close to her family while I went to school. Really liked the ultra-low State taxes, cheap housing, and strong job market, but there's not much in the way of recreation opportunities unless your family owns private land that you have access to, or if you live in one of the bigger towns, Grand Forks, Bismark, or Fargo, and have a lot of indoor hobbies.\n5. Minnesota, came here for a job opportunity, live in one of the prettiest areas I ever have, Duluth, right by Lake Superior. The winters are intense, but we've embraced it snowmobiling, skiing, and spending time with friends. Summers here are absolutely beautiful, being by the big lake keeps us cooler, and there is lots of public land, parks, and even trails right though the city in the greenspace for hiking and mountain biking.  It feels like a greener, more lush Colorado in a lot of ways, (except for the cold) and because Minnesota is home to so many huge companies, 3M, Post cereal, General Mills, Target, United Healthcare, Land O Lakes, Hormel, Toro, US Bank, Best Buy, CHS, Polaris, Arctic Cat, and many more, we have a very well funded State government, which does a very admirable job (for the US, still not as generous as Canada) of taking care of it's citizens through healthcare, infrastructure, education, etc. Taxes are higher than ND, but so is the opportunity. Main thing I don't like is the weather in the winter can be really tough, and the salt on the roads eats cars over time, much worse than CO, and even a little worse than ND, they get a little less snow over there. It also takes a while to make friends in my particular town, I think just because it's smaller, there are more locals, and they don't always want more friends. Have to become part of a church, club, or foster friendships at work.\n\nHope that's somewhat helpful for you.",

They have great, varied seasons, beautiful falls, pleasant summers. The cities are quaint, clean and progressive. The people are generally affluent outside of a few very destitute Trump towns. The governments are well run and funded, and the states work effectively. They have fantastic educational institutions, pretty mountains, nice shoreline. They very rarely experience natural disasters and are extremely stable regions. When one thinks of \u201cclassic USA\u201d these states and their style come to mind. I\u2019m sure naysayers will jump in with examples of problems with these states- but those issues are microscopic compared to states like Mississippi and Tennessee. Yikes, filled with poor stupid people, ugly weather and natural disasters galore and so on.\nThe other states that are being claimed have too many issues.

I was a Union Pipefitter before and we make $32 an hour!!! For reference that same job in Boston makes $60 an hour!! Vermont is the 3rd highest C.O.L. state in the country! All the tourism spots/ industry are getting hit hard because no one can afford to live in these vacation towns so that's starting to suffer. Jay Peak went from 1500 employees to 300. \n\nIt's not even that safe anymore. You used to be able to walk around Burlington at night without a care now you run the risk of getting shot, stabbed, jumped or having your stuff stolen. Also, Vermont has a incredibly big opioid/drug problem and it's getting worse by the day. We're a pretty central hub, think about it; Boston is 4 Hours, NYC is 6 or so, Montreal is like 2.5-3. People stop here quickly, make their sales and bounce back home. \n\nAll states have their problems but Vermont used to be a hidden gem. I think the isolation of COVID really exposed it as this \"safe haven\" and it's still cheaper than living in Cali or NYC so people moved. Don't get me wrong it is a beautiful state and some pretty amazing people.",

In Greensboro just walking out of my car is a wrong side of town somebody pulled a fully automatic Uzi out on me and pointed it in my face for no reason other than I'm just naturally aloof and he took it as an offense. I didn't say a word and and I was surprisingly calm while just looking at at him in the eyes, he pretty quickly walked away but this town is no joke bro you better know where you're at you better know where to avoid and if you start a business here learn that we play by a different set of rules where there are no rules. And that's almost exclusively referring to retail sales in any shape or form. Yeah your competitors maybe working with organized crime just scare you into submission or even worse. Unmarked guns are everywhere. In that incident with the uzi was one of many incidences where I just went in the parking lot simply and ask somebody to lift their shirt up just to show me that they've got you know a handgun or a Glock or whatever it's really really fested with all types of illegal fully automatic machine guns and mini unmarked weapons.",

            "Ah, my friend, let me tell you of a place that many people do not know exists: the desert of Washington.  Tumbleweeds, dust storms, high winds, brush fires, regular 100+ degree temps in the summer... as soon as you cross the cascades heading east, you begin to see yellow cheat grass around the bottom of the evergreen pines and firs that everyone thinks about when they think of WA. As you make your way towards Yakima you notice that the trees become less and less. By the time you reach Prosser, there are almost no naturally growing trees and they have been replaced by sage brush. Continue on that path for another 30 miles or so and you reach the Tri-Cities (or as the locals affectionately refer to it: the Dry-Shitties). If you have money, it is great - It's only good if you dont. This is where the Snake,  Yakima, and Columbia rivers converge yielding great fishing for salmon, trout, SMB, steelhead, walleye, and sturgeon. There is plenty of water space for wakeboarding, jet skiing, and whatever else you could dream of doing on the water.\n\n This place sits centrally located with several ski slopes within a 3 hour drive. Arguably Bluewood has some of the best snow in the country (I'll argue that to my death). If shitty weather is forecasted for Dayton/Bluewood, no worries, just head the other direction to the subpar snow of White Pass. Feeling like going a different route? Go south to Anthony Lakes (Oregon) or North to 49. \n\nAre you more of an offroad vehicle type? Free (at least the last time i was there) motocross track riding is available at Horn Rapids. Horn Rapids also houses a sprint boat track, kart track, ATV track, BMX track, and im sure more now. There are several public land riding spots nearby too if you want sand. The Juniper sand dunes and Moses Hole will keep you entertained. There used to be one of the best and most meticulously maintained motocross/supercross tracks i have ever ridden at ToesMXP, but i think they may have closed.\n\nI lived there up until 2009, and have since lived in Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, and Virginia and realize now how spoiled I was growing up there. The cost of living has absolutely exploded though. My mom bought her new construction home in 1994 for $70k (1300sf, 1/4 acre, 3br/2ba), and a house on the next street over is currently pending sale for $360k. Gas prices flirt with $5/gal. The last time i was there was 2019, and I will say that it is not the same tri cities that i grew up in, but it's still a pretty great place if you can get past the gang violence and not focus on the negatives.",

Wisconsin and Minnesota both have colder more snow and icy winters than Michigan! Also, you could say the love of automobiles and popular music is almost like a religion in the modern western world! With Motown music and all the other gigantic music talents that have come out of Detroit and Michigan and the fact that Detroit and Michigan put this nation into automobiles sets this state apart in a very unique way!

The only cons are hard winters and somewhat rude people-if you aren\u2019t accustomed to it. The pros are myriad. The people there are well-educated, highly cultured, competent and responsible. They have great, varied seasons, beautiful falls, pleasant summers. The cities are quaint, clean and progressive. The people are generally affluent outside of a few very destitute Trump towns. The governments are well run and funded, and the states work effectively. They have fantastic educational institutions, pretty mountains, nice shoreline. They very rarely experience natural disasters and are extremely stable regions. When one thinks of \u201cclassic USA\u201d these states and their style come to mind. I\u2019m sure naysayers will jump in with examples of problems with these states- but those issues are microscopic compared to states like Mississippi and Tennessee. Yikes, filled with poor stupid people, ugly weather and natural disasters galore and so on.\nThe other states that are being claimed have too many issues.

            "Ah, my friend, let me tell you of a place that many people do not know exists: the desert of Washington.  Tumbleweeds, dust storms, high winds, brush fires, regular 100+ degree temps in the summer... as soon as you cross the cascades heading east, you begin to see yellow cheat grass around the bottom of the evergreen pines and firs that everyone thinks about when they think of WA. As you make your way towards Yakima you notice that the trees become less and less. By the time you reach Prosser, there are almost no naturally growing trees and they have been replaced by sage brush. Continue on that path for another 30 miles or so and you reach the Tri-Cities (or as the locals affectionately refer to it: the Dry-Shitties). If you have money, it is great - It's only good if you dont. This is where the Snake,  Yakima, and Columbia rivers converge yielding great fishing for salmon, trout, SMB, steelhead, walleye, and sturgeon. There is plenty of water space for wakeboarding, jet skiing, and whatever else you could dream of doing on the water.\n\n This place sits centrally located with several ski slopes within a 3 hour drive. Arguably Bluewood has some of the best snow in the country (I'll argue that to my death). If shitty weather is forecasted for Dayton/Bluewood, no worries, just head the other direction to the subpar snow of White Pass. Feeling like going a different route? Go south to Anthony Lakes (Oregon) or North to 49. \n\nAre you more of an offroad vehicle type? Free (at least the last time i was there) motocross track riding is available at Horn Rapids. Horn Rapids also houses a sprint boat track, kart track, ATV track, BMX track, and im sure more now. There are several public land riding spots nearby too if you want sand. The Juniper sand dunes and Moses Hole will keep you entertained. There used to be one of the best and most meticulously maintained motocross/supercross tracks i have ever ridden at ToesMXP, but i think they may have closed.\n\nI lived there up until 2009, and have since lived in Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, and Virginia and realize now how spoiled I was growing up there. The cost of living has absolutely exploded though. My mom bought her new construction home in 1994 for $70k (1300sf, 1/4 acre, 3br/2ba), and a house on the next street over is currently pending sale for $360k. Gas prices flirt with $5/gal. The last time i was there was 2019, and I will say that it is not the same tri cities that i grew up in, but it's still a pretty great place if you can get past the gang violence and not focus on the negatives.",

Tombstone and Bisbee were both tough towns in the old west, but Tombstone is the champ for the paradigm of the outlaw.\n\nWe have massive caverns and caves - Kartchner and Colossal. \n\nWe have a nuclear missile silo that you can visit. We have an airplane graveyard full of famous dead birds, like Kennedy's Air Force One.\n\nWe have a big hole in the northern part of the state, that some people have heard about. We have a sunset crater and a meteor crater.\n\nWe have a massive liberal city - Tucson. We have the fifth largest city in America, that was once a republican stronghold, but is getting more and more purple - Phoenix.\n\nWe have arid desert. We have pine and snow covered mountains. We have tundra!\n\nWe have lakes and rivers and hikes full of petroglyphs.\n\nEvery part of the state looks different if you drive long enough in a given direction.",

They have great, varied seasons, beautiful falls, pleasant summers. The cities are quaint, clean and progressive. The people are generally affluent outside of a few very destitute Trump towns. The governments are well run and funded, and the states work effectively. They have fantastic educational institutions, pretty mountains, nice shoreline. They very rarely experience natural disasters and are extremely stable regions. When one thinks of \u201cclassic USA\u201d these states and their style come to mind. I\u2019m sure naysayers will jump in with examples of problems with these states- but those issues are microscopic compared to states like Mississippi and Tennessee.

And if arguing for straight beauty, the Kenai Peninsula has it beat.  \n\n20 years ago, I would have said CO, but it has grown more crowded, and strong employment opportunities are harder to come by.\n\nI see MA ranked higher.  Fuck that!  Want a family?  Ever see any children while visiting Boston? Nope, only the wealthy can afford them.  The food is decent, but absurdly expensive.  Drivers? They're called Massholes for a reason.  The neighboring states hate them for a reason.  That said, I wish the rest of the country had their education and Healthcare.\n\nCalifornia is California.  It has more microclimates than anywhere in the US, and is competitive with the most on the planet.  The marks against it? HCOL, the people are less friendly, and the public education is mediocre.  It's beautiful, and the tacos are amazing.  It's a great place to be rich.\n\nMany places have their positives, and some truly suck.  When I read, \"I would only live in NY or LA,\" that strikes me as ignorant and absurd.  If you can find contentment where your needs (and many of your personal wants are met), treasure it.\n\nAs I get older, community, safety, and freedom from fiscal stress have become more important to me.

Half the state is heavily forested and flagstaff gets the third most average inches of snow every year out of any city in the US, including alaska. We actually have tundra in AZ lol,\n\nA lot of people see arizona as a big desert, it really isn't that at least half isn't even Alaska. Then the food in AZ, is just absolutely amazing.\n\nI won't say it has the level of variety of California, and this isn't to take anything away from Cali, because cali is absolutely beautiful but AZ is more then people think it is."

The only bad thing is the price. the price makes you go bankrupt. and crime is bad to. not as bad as missouri but still pretty bad. I mean if your a native of new york the lox is legandary. and 99 cents pizza is amazing. its like a scifi movie. just  dont live in manhataan but i would love to visit. and plus there is awsome 99 cents stores that sell everything you can dream of"
