            "Never say never, but Hawaii. Terrified of flying.",
            "Hawaii, because I can\u2019t afford the airfare.",
            "Hawaii and Alaska are the 2 Least likely. But I\u2019d love to see every state at least once. From poor to rich, liberal to conservative. I\u2019d like to set foot in all 50 before I die",
            "Hawaii... I'll never have the money to go there.",
            "Hawaii, I've read about the negative impact tourism has had on them, so have no interest in contributing to that.",
            "Hawaii, everyone I know who went there had fun but said everything is insanely expensive. They do have to ship or fly a lot of stuff in so I get the high prices.",
            "At this point FL, I'm from Hawaii and FL seems like a MAGA paradise.\u00a0",
            "Hawaii. I'd have to fly there or boat there. Neither of which my wife will do and I don't plan on leaving her home while I go so I guess I'm not going.",
            "Hawaii, at least if I gotta fly Boeing. Show me that Airbus baby!!",
            "Alaska or Hawaii cause I have sea sickness and hate flying with a burning pasion",
            "Hawaii, cause I sure as sunrise will never be able to afford it. Only reason I can afford to leave my current state at all is that I live on the border and the bus goes across the river.",
            "Hawaii. I'd need to fly or swim, there's no way I'm walking there.",
            "I've been to all 50 states, all of them twice or many many more, except Hawaii because of distance and Florida. Because, ew, Florida.",
            "Alaska. I could see myself driving through the lower 48 states and visiting Hawaii. I don\u2019t see myself purposely going to Alaska unless it was just so I could say I visited all 50 states.",
            "Hawaii.\n\nI'm sure it's beautiful, but for a 12+ hour plane ride, I'm not a fan of beaches, and I don't think it would be worthwhile. \n\nI'd rather use that 12+ hours to go somewhere in Europe or even Alaska.",
            "Hawaii too far away too expensive",
            "Hawaii. White people shouldn't go to Hawaii.",
            "Florida: too hot, too ghetto.   Alaska and Hawaii: too far away and too expensive.   Most of the southern states: too racist.  I am a born and bred Californian and I am proud",
            "I've been to almost all the US states multiple times except Alaska and Hawaii. For the most part they're all the same, every one has redeemable qualities and shitty qualities. Rural areas are almost universally the same and a bit racist and conservative. Large cities are almost always far more liberal and diverse.\u00a0",
            "Florida for obvious reasons. Hawaii for ethical reasons.",
            "most likely Alaska and Hawaii, because they are far away",
            "It's hard to say. I've lived in a lot of different places growing up as an Army brat. I live in Oklahoma, love the people but hate the blast furnace hot summers. So for me probably someplace that is too hot. I have been to Hawaii but couldn't go back, the weather is just too hot.",
            "Hawaii, because how the hell am I going to afford to get there?",
            "I\u2019m missing 3 states out of the 50 where I\u2019ve set foot (missing Hawaii, Delaware and Vermont.) I hope to visit Hawaii and Vermont some day. Delaware\u2026 well, if I\u2019m ever in the neighborhood, I\u2019d do it to cross it off my list.\n\nI can\u2019t think of one I would *refuse* to visit ever again, but I really cannot think of a reason I\u2019d ever have occasion to set foot in North Dakota again.",
            "Hawaii. \n\nI just don't think I'll ever have the budget to go there.",
            "Alaska or Hawaii. It just seems like I\u2019ll never make it to either place.",
            "Probably Alaska because it\u2019s so remote. Hawaii I lived in for 4 years as a kid and I went back on a vacation in 2016.",
            "Boy, I don't think I'm ever going to go to Hawaii now",
            "Probably Hawaii cause damn it\u2019s far & would require a big bridge or aircraft or boat to reach lol",
            "Probably Alaska and Hawaii because I don't fly and don't much care for boats.",
            "Hawaii or Alaska. Because I'm a poor Midwestern girl \ud83d\ude02",
            "None. Already been to the contiguous 48. Alaska and Hawaii are up next. I've found every state has some really cool stuff. Even Mississippi",
            "We'll see. I'm 62, and have been to 44 of the 50 states and of course DC as well, but progress is pretty slow at this point, at least since I last added Alabama in 2021. I've never been to Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Alaska, and Hawaii, but I live in New England, which is thousands of miles from all of them, ranging from 1260 miles to Mississippi all the way to around 6000 miles to Hawaii. I wouldn't mind going on one more long road trip to hit up some of the ones I'm missing, but on the other hand, what's in North Dakota or Oklahoma I want to see?",
            "None. I'm only missing 4. Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Wyoming.",
            "Hawaii, because it shouldn't even be part of the U.S.",
            "Statistically speaking Hawaii or Alaska",
            "Hawaii and North Dakota are the only two I haven\u2019t been to.   Can\u2019t afford Hawaii, can\u2019t think of a good enough reason to go to North Dakota.  So probably either of those.  \n\nI should probably redo Maine properly at some point though.  My only visit to Maine was during a drive from Montreal to Boston when I realized I could claim a Maine visit with a short detour.  Got off at the first exit, stepped out of the car in a parking lot, got back in and continued to Boston.  That state deserves better.",
            "I\u2019ll probably never make it to Hawaii and Alaska. I\u2019ve been to most all of the other states",
            "Get fucked Texas, but probably Hawaii cause that's not my thing",
            "I have a very close friend who decided to stop living like those who are trying to get ahead and moved to Hawaii to help take care of a a farm.  He basically worked some hippie lady\u2019s garden and lived in a tent.  \nHe eventually quit the gardening gig and got a a job working on a whale watching boat.  He was kind of a hired helper so to speak not like the guide but made comps from tips. He still lived in a tent. His brother was air force and based in anchorage and he started to spend summers in Alaska. He lived like a nomad and found a woman who was doing the same. They moved back and forth from Hawaii to Alaska. Winters in Hawaii and summers in Alaska.  He somehow saved a few bucks and bought a homestead in far north west Alaska close to the ocean.  They live there full time and he lives off grid and off what he gets from the land.  That\u2019s the story of my friend Matt.  He used to be the greatest guitar player I had ever seen and played 12 string acoustic while we drank cheap whiskey. He says he doesn\u2019t play much anymore but has been thinking about getting a guitar again.",
            "I have not visited 2 - North Dakota and Hawaii.  I have no reason to ever go to ND, so I am guessing that will end up being the only one I don't go to.  Hawaii I will get to one of these days.",
            "I hope to step foot in all of them before I\u2019m dead and gone. Alaska and Hawaii would be the toughest obviously",
            "I don't think I could afford to go to Hawaii.\n\nBut from the perspective of having a choice in the matter, and not counting states I've already been to? Most likely Nebraska, or one of the Dakotas. I see no point.",
            "I will probably never go to Hawaii.  I do like beaches, and they do have a cool culture.    I would have to fly in, and then stay in some fancy hotel.  And that is not my style.    Give me a rustic place on a dirt road and I am happy.",
            "Hawaii because it\u2019s a long flight",
            "Can\u2019t say absolutely, but most likely Alaska. Would love to see it but probably won\u2019t ever have a reason to make such a big trip. \n\nHoneymooned in Hawaii so at least I didn\u2019t miss out on that one.  Otherwise, I\u2019ve got a shot at reaching any of the contiguous states I haven\u2019t been to yet, at some point.",
            "I've been to every state except Hawaii.  But I'd go to Hawaii.",
            "probably non of them, I have no plans of going to any of them. If I had to choose one, i\u2019d most likely go to Hawaii, but other than that it\u2019s a hard pass",
            "At this point Hawaii is the only one it could be. Unless I die before next year though the answer is none.",
            "Because of the cost, Hawaii.",
            "I'd say Hawaii, because I don't like flying, but if a spouse/partner really wanted to go, I'd go. Same with any other state.",
            "Bold of you to assume there's only one. I'd flip this, I think I'd only go to Hawaii. Zero interest in going anywhere else in the states.",
            "Hawaii. California, North Dakota \n\nHawaii and cali because im super poor and couldn't afford to however north dakota is simpky because I dont ever want to go mainly because of the weather cold and windy as hell in the summer its balls hot and windy also.",
            "Hawaii. seems overcrowded and overpriced",
            "Probably Alaska, since I\u2019ve already been to Hawaii. I\u2019m not saying absolutely, but probably, because I can\u2019t see a situation in which I would just happen to need to drive through Alaska.",
            "Definitely Hawaii because that's expensive and I live north enough to have a better chance at visiting Alaska even though it's unlikely.\n\nDefinitely don't care about visiting a lot of other states though.",
            "I'm fortunate enough to have driven through all lower 48, most of them multiple times for vacations. Also been to Alaska. Will get to Hawaii soon. The only state I can honestly say I wouldn't make another trip to see is North Dakota. I saw the Teddy Roosevelt National Park, the bison, the badlands, and the ground hog towns.....really, that's all there is to see. Once, for a few hours, was absolutely enough. Kansas and Nebraska are close seconds.",
            "Hawaii. Can\u2019t swim that far.",
            "Hawaii. Because I can't afford it.",
            "All of them except California and Hawaii. At least, if I had my way.",
            "Alaska or Hawaii probably. I don\u2019t have plane or cruise money lol",
            "Probably Alaska. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019d like to go, but without any real reason to spend the money, it\u2019s probably the least likeliest I\u2019ll get there. (Already stepped foot in Hawaii on a layover to Australia, so that rules that out.)",
            "The only state I have not been in is Hawaii,and probably never will because a long flight over water freaks me out",
            "Probably Alaska or Hawaii since those two are very far away from me and would require extra effort and money to reach lol",
            "I\u2019ve been to 47. The only possible one is Hawaii. Both of the Carolina\u2019s are the other two but I should hit them this summer or next. Hawaii doesn\u2019t appeal to me; is too expensive for what does appeal to me. So unless something changes dramatically in my life, Hawaii but there is a bit of a weird desire to have all 50.",
            "Hawaii because I am not a fan of the amount of people nor the tropical climate",
            "Hawaii, requires a plane to get there and i will never get on a fucking plane. i hate heights wayy too much",
            "You guys sure stay on point.  I scrolled down a good way, and no one answered the question.  Only Hawaii, houses there, phony reality real estate tv, lizard poaching, social security, blah yada snark and more.  Passing non-answers of Arizona and Alabama.\n\nWhat's the one US state you will absolutely never step foot in and why?  Roller coasters!  Stinky diapers!  Thor!\n\nFlorida! Flat, hot, guns and other shit.",
            "The only two I can say \"never\" about are most likely Alaska and Hawaii and that's just because they are more difficult to reach/afford.",
            "All of them now. The US no longer seems full of possibilities and wonder. To be fair, Canada is giving good face to the world now either. Western culture has lost its mystique as some people want progress and inclusivity and others will kill to keep the status quo. What a fucked up time to be here.\u00a0\nAlso, Hawaii because the cousins asked us not to.\u00a0",
            "Hawaii, because it's permanently contaminated.  What happened is, after I completed basic training, my platoon senior drill sergeant got stationed there, and he permanently contaminated it with his presence! \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06",
            "Hawaii, because i'm terrified of flying.",
            "I've been to every state except Hawaii.\n\n\nHonestly, I don't think that there's a lot of super, super horrible places in the US, especially on a statewide level. Like yeah, there's shitty parts in every state, so what? Mississippi isn't that bad, and I'm down there a few times a year.",
            "Hawaii. Rude people, so many other less expensive and cleaner places to go on vacation.  Puerto Rico and Costa Rico are a thousand times more beautiful, less crime and very friendly people who take care of the environments around them.",
            "I\u2019ve been in every state except Hawaii, mostly for  work. \n I have never had a worse experience than that of Jackson, Mississippi. \n I\u2019m a white male. \n The place is, by an extreme margin, the most racist place I\u2019ve ever been. \n Four times in one week, other white men, complete strangers to me, initiated conversation with incredibly racist statements. \n As if they were looking for validation. \n If there is a place in the US with a KKK, it\u2019s Jackson, MS. \n \nOn a happier note, I had a long running personal poll of happiness running. \n I\u2019d ask people: \u201cSo\u2026. How do you like living here?\u201d\n The most common response was something along the lines of \u201c Meh. It has its pros and cons. it\u2019s ok overall.\u201d\nWith two exceptions. \n NYC and Minneapolis. \n  Both got enthusiastic responses along the lines of \u201c I can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else\u201d\n NYC denizens explained how it was 24/7 and variety and multicultural. \n Minneapolis residents loved how it was an urban area with nice people and diversity. \n \nThere\u2019s a life lesson about happiness and prejudice in there somewhere.",
            "Again? Rhode Island. Realistically Hawaii but I want to see all 50 in my life. I\u2019d like to even drive across the US and up to Alaska.",
            "Hawaii surrounded by water and I hate swimming",
            "Probably either Alaska or Hawaii (honestly probably anything west of the Mississippi River, or maybe at most the Rockies...) bc I don't have the disposable income or time to travel that far. I haven't even been out of my home state since like 2017...",
            "I probably won't get to Hawaii due to expenses.",
            "Hawaii, it seems they don't want tourists there, and it feels unwelcoming.  I don't enjoy going where I'm not wanted.",
            "Well, I've been to every State except Hawaii and I plan on checking that off my list soon, but there are certainly States I wouldn't *revisit.* I never actually stopped anywhere in Kansas or Oklahoma other than maybe a tollbooth or gas station. I don't really know why I'd go back other than just passing through. Most States have something of interest even if overall the State is kind of a bore, though. Even the Dakotas have a few National Parks and some beautiful scenery, though most of the Dakotas are painfully boring (and windy).",
            "There isn't one. I've been to most states. I guess Alaska and Hawaii are the least likely because I won't be just driving through them, I'd have to plan specifically to go there.",
            "Hawaii, California, and Nevada. California because it's a state of traffic and people are just weird, plus it's stupid expensive. Nevada because most of it is desert and Vegas isn't anyplace I'd ever go to. Hawaii because what it's become, is a tourist trap, and the interesting parts that the natives had have been swindled or stolen. \n\nFlorida is a close second because I already lived there and between the snowbirds trying to kill you, the tourists, and the retirees, there are a lot of wack jobs who only vote 1 way just because.",
            "Probably Alaska or Hawaii because they\u2019re extremely far",
            "Probably Alaska or Hawaii. Too far.",
            "Hawaii, because the real indigenous Hawaiians are being decimated by the tourism industry and can't afford to live on their own land. Land which was unfairly forced into US control.",
            "Hawaii. It seems nice and all, but it's so far away from everything.",
            "There's a yellow rose in Texas, that I won't be going to see.\n\nAlso Alaska and Hawaii because poor.",
            "Hawaii",
            "Just one?\n\nI'm trans so now I stick with New England, the West Coast, and Hawaii. \n\nAnywhere else- nope.",
            "i read MOST POSTS & Hawaii was voted the state you absolutely never step foot in !!!!!!!!!! & I DON'T SEE/KNOW WHY???????????\n\nI REALIZE HOW COSTLY IT IS !!!!!!STILL  WHY????????????",
            "Hawaii or Puerto Rico. Other than that I'm not afraid to go anywhere",
            "Hawaii. Tried to go twice. First time, my grandmother fell ill and died when we would have been there. The second time we had it scheduled, my mother\u2019s boyfriend died right before. I\u2019m not risking any more family. Fuck that place.",
            "Alaska and Hawaii for financial reasons",
            "If you would of ask this say 30 yrs. ago and I know what I know now, without a doubt it would be Hawaii, don't get me wrong, I love the locals - you can't find much better people, but the Cost of Living is only for the wealthy, I've been here that long and can't move off the island because every part of my income is accounted for by the rent and so on.)\n\nI mean as an example when you go into the Grocery store, to buy basic things (Milk, Bread, etc.) and pay more than $50. for those 4 things, it makes it impossible to be able to save . ( Milk - gallon $8. Bread $6. - Eggs - $9. and some sort of meat or protein)\n\nI'm so wanting to move back to the mainland, but I've come to grips that the only way that will happen is one of three ways - (1) I hit the lottery and Hawaii don't even have the Lottery, (2) Someway they build a bridge from the islands to the mainland ( I don't see that happening when it took the State over 50 yrs. to construct a freeway of 27 miles, or the last 14 yrs. trying to build a skyline trolley) and here is the 3rd, Swim from Hawaii to Cali with only your essentials (2,600 miles) and I'm not a huge fan of the Ocean, that belongs to all the sharks and big fishes and I don't believe in being \"Shark bait\" for no body. /s",
            "Hawaii, I went to the Virgin Islands and felt trapped. If something would have happened while I was there that I could never have left I probably would have went for a short swim in a deep ocean.",
            "Probably Hawaii, since the government is burning entire cities to grab land. If I do, I'm wearing blue.",
            "Alaska, and Hawaii, because I'm too poor to travel. \n\nFlorida because I'm too poor to go Disneyland, and also because people in Florida are nuts. \n\nOklahoma, because I drove through it once and the only word that comes to mind is desolation.",
            "Ive already been to all the lower 48 so probably Alaska or Hawaii",
            "Already set foot in a lot of states (including Hawaii), I think the only states I haven't that I've no desire to go to would be NJ, Alabama, and Mississippi. I can't think of anything they have that I'd want to go to them to see.",
            "Louisiana, Mississippi and Hawaii. I\u2019d love to say Alabama but my husband was born and raised there. I only visit when we have to\u2026.",
            "Hawaii. I'm a millennial. And I think that's all the info required to fully understand.",
            "Alaska and Hawaii because I'm poor. Every state west of the Mississippi except California, Nevada, and Arizona because iv already been to them. \n\nPretty much if I haven't been there traveling is too expensive at this point to go more than 2 hours away.",
            "Hawaii... can't afford to go there and even if I could, I'd go somewhere else",
            "Alaska or Hawaii because $$$",
            "Probably Alaska or Hawaii. Not because of any political reasons,  just because they are far from the CONUS.",
            "Hawaii is a bunch of tiny VOLCANIC islands surrounded by sharks and a 15,000 foot ocean. Why anyone other than a scientist with hazard pay is willing to risk being blown up by a volcano to be eaten by sharks on the way down to a very, very, very deep grave is beyond me.",
            "Never *again?* Florida. Not if I can help it. Damn that state is the worst. \n\nIn terms of states that I won't ever step in that I haven't already been to, it's a life goal of mine to visit all 50... but the top four most likely for me to miss out on are Alaska and Hawaii (they're so out of the way and expensive) and North Dakota and West Virginia (I've been to every bordering state and there's nothing interesting to do in either state that's worth traveling so far to do, since I wouldn't get any other new states out of either trip)",
            "Hawaii and California",
            "Puerto Rico \n\nI have little interest in it, I've already drove to Alaska and flown to Hawaii\n\nOthers I just have yet to visit",
            "I don't want to answer this question about states I find negative because, inevitably, something will happen and I'll end up there.\n\nIf this were true of states I actually \\*want\\* to live, I'd say Hawaii and California, because I'd love to live in either. Alas, I am not wealthy enough to do so.",
            "Hawaii.\n\nI\u2019ve been to a beach.",
            "Hawaii because I\u2019ve seen too many pleas from indigenous people to not go there. I haven\u2019t looked into it enough, but there are other places with volcanos I can see.",
            "Hawaii because fuck the tropics its too damn hot and humid florida's bad enough. the only reason to go would be vacationing but I wouldnt want to vacation there, being one that has zero intrest in the beach and hates hot weather.\n\nIf we want to make political jabs California, however naturally the state is very beautiful, just too bad its run by fucking morons.\n\nin reality I just want nothing to do with the cities\n\nI pray I will NEVER set foot in NYC or LA\n\nrather not go anywhere near detroit or chicago either.\n\nBoston is ok i guess but fuck driving there\n\nFor a positive note i would love to visit Montana and do some hunting and fishing",
            "Alabama, Arkansas, or Mississippi.  I've been to all but 6 states. Hawaii and Alaska because they're more expensive to get to. And Louisiana just hasn't come up yet. But I'll never go to Alabama, Arkansas,  or Mississippi because I hear they're still generally racist states.",
            "Hawaii. I'd like to it just isn't like me to fly over thousands of miles of ocean",

There\u2019s really those birds making that \u201coo-oo-oo-aa-aa\u201d sound. No joke. Every morning at 10:10 it rained for about 15 minutes then stopped. Green, green, green everywhere. I wish my father had kept my grandfather\u2019s house about a quarter mile from the Pacific Ocean. Very expensive, but the Hawaiian people are cool.",
            "Best vacation I ever took was to Hawaii.  I was around 25 at the time, none of my friends, BF, could afford to go.  Went by myself. 11 days.\n\nHad saved years for this, so went alone.  Most welcoming people ever, but I also researched and respected how they live, different way of life, and I am from the western part of continental states.\n\nWent to 3 or 5 islands, was welcomed everywhere.  Even invited to a wedding that was fabulous.\n\nBest vacation I ever have had.",

You're probably still talking a minimum of $1,000 but if you can save $100/mo, you've got that in a year. \n\nMy recent trip there was about $2,000, but I did some of the more touristy things like a luau and snorkeling, and flew between multiple islands. You could do a long weekend on the Big Island for much less. I stayed in a budget but clean and well kept motel in Hilo for only like $140/night. I've paid more than that in much crappier cities.\n\nAll just depends on the experience you want.

            "Alabama. \n\nOnce I had to drive through Alabama to get back home to Southeast Texas (I\u2019m originally from MD. Was living in TX). I was with my boyfriend (now husband) at the time. Btw- I\u2019m white. He\u2019s black. The entire time he says he wants to skip Alabama (aka, no stops - drive straight thru). Well\u2026 I got hungry\u2026 in Birmingham. \n\nWe pull into a McDonalds. I stress over the calories. I look on my phone for a better option and decide Chick fil a. (I know - not much better.) I Google. He backs out dot head there. \n\nWe turn onto the road from the McDonalds parking lot. Woop woop! There go the lights. We are pulled over by white officers. They stand by the car but do not speak to us. We repeatedly ask why we were pulled over. No responses. Their backs are to the vehicle while they wait by both of our windows. About 10 min later, a black cop shows up. He talks to us. Asks us the usual - who are we, why are we here. He then asks about drugs in the car! At this point - we had both been sober multiple years. 0 drugs, alcohol, anything in that vehicle. We say that. Clearly we were credible because he lets us go. But damn. He said they thought it was suspicious that we pulled into a McDonalds, did not exit the car, and pulled back out. I was just being indecisive!!!!! \n\nNeedless to say, I haven\u2019t lived that down with my husband after he repeatedly told me we weren\u2019t stopping in Alabama. I wish that was our only unfortunate run in with police - but it wasn\u2019t. Racism is alive and thriving in many places.",

Like Green Mile and Deliverance except 100x worse, and just like Texas you expect to get the death penalty just for parking in the wrong place.  Guns everywhere, religion everywhere, from what I've seen even the cops talk like white trash and can't string a sentence together.\n\nThe runner-up prize would be Indiana.  Just boring as fuck and there's nothing there whatsoever.",

            "Probably Mississippi or Alabama. Not because I'm actively avoiding them. But they're far away from where I live (Idaho) and I can't think of anything that would compel me to specifically go there, or have a need to drive through it. Compared to Georgia or Florida, which are also far away, but I've been there already because they have more attractions like theme parks and major cities like Atlanta. At some point I'd like to visit all the states though (I'm open to visiting them all, unlike some people in this thread), but those two will probably be among the last.",

I've never been to Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Alaska, and Hawaii, but I live in New England, which is thousands of miles from all of them, ranging from 1260 miles to Mississippi all the way to around 6000 miles to Hawaii. I wouldn't mind going on one more long road trip to hit up some of the ones I'm missing, but on the other hand, what's in North Dakota or Oklahoma I want to see?",

I grew up in West Virginia and I\u2019d avoid that backwards state if I could but my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents live there so we visit every other weekend.",
            "Mississippi/Alabama/Louisiana \nThink of them as one sinkhole of poverty, poor health systems, poor education system, and deep racism, crazy humidity, corrupt politics and businesses. \n\nOnly somewhat redeeming quality is the gulf coast. But, that is not enough to tip me",

I\u2019m a bit biased because it\u2019s my home city but it\u2019s chalked full of history and good food and across the bridge are some beautiful beaches in gulf shores and orange beach. I moved to upstate New York and I miss the weather everyday.",

Only Hawaii, houses there, phony reality real estate tv, lizard poaching, social security, blah yada snark and more.

Flat, hot, guns and other shit.",

            "I have been to all 50. There are none that I absolutely would not visit again. There are some I don't care for much ( yes, I am talking about you Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma) but pretty much every state has some really cool things to see and do.",

If I have to go through \"The South,\" I stick to the Gulf Coast (which is fantastic) and drive as fast as I can if I have to venture deeper into the state. I've only ever been threatened with a gun once in my life, and it was in Alabama...or Georgia...can't remember which. It was the most ridiculously stereotypical story involving me taking a wrong turn. It would have been funny if my wife and kids weren't there and terrified.\n\nFlorida is interesting. All around the edges is paradise, but there's also an underlying bitterness towards outsiders when you hit certain spots. Very understandable though.",

We took off from Fort Benning in Georgia, but jumped out of the plane onto Friar (Fryar?) DZ in Alabama. The sixth time I went in was by car, to go and spend a month in SERE-C at Rucker. \n\n...which is to say that every time I went to Alabama, I was scared absolutely, balls-to-the-wall shitless.\n\n....Huntsville's nice.

This grown-up version of Space Camp was called Space Academy since it provided academic higher education.\n\nThis innovative NASA program suggests to me that perhaps K-12 public education in Alabama runs the gamut of good to poor (my guess is that its quality probably depends on location and demographic factors) - or that the state might excel in some academic areas (e.g. STEM) but lag in others.\n\nI hope someone with knowledge about Alabama's school system can confirm or rebut this - and I'd also like to know if Space Academy still exists for the state's K-12 teachers.\ud83d\ude80(I hope that it does!)",

It would be like arguing that we should get rid of seatbelts because car crash mortality is down, ignoring the fact that seatbelts are one of the reasons it is low in the first place.\n\nAnd no, I don't think we need to debate when life begins with the religious right.

Please, Louisianans, run away! Run for your lives!",

I currently live in Custer, South Dakota, a state which many people would assume that there\u2019s no reason to visit. I think it is so beautiful here. Many people who stop by the Black Hills on their way to Yellowstone say this wish they had devoted more time to explore our area. \n\nI think the Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota is simply beautiful. Medora is a fun little town to visit. I really enjoy visiting Bismarck in the warm months. I just like walking along the river, visiting the craft breweries, visiting the Capitol, etc\u2026 \n\nI can\u2019t imagine crossing a whole state off my list.",
            "North Dakota.\n\nNot because I particularly have a problem with the state..  It's just pretty far out of the way unless you're specifically needing to go there.",

Delaware\u2026 well, if I\u2019m ever in the neighborhood, I\u2019d do it to cross it off my list.\n\nI can\u2019t think of one I would *refuse* to visit ever again, but I really cannot think of a reason I\u2019d ever have occasion to set foot in North Dakota again.",

I've never been to Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Alaska, and Hawaii, but I live in New England, which is thousands of miles from all of them, ranging from 1260 miles to Mississippi all the way to around 6000 miles to Hawaii.

So probably either of those.  \n\nI should probably redo Maine properly at some point though.  My only visit to Maine was during a drive from Montreal to Boston when I realized I could claim a Maine visit with a short detour.  Got off at the first exit, stepped out of the car in a parking lot, got back in and continued to Boston.  That state deserves better.",

I saw the Teddy Roosevelt National Park, the bison, the badlands, and the ground hog towns.....really, that's all there is to see. Once, for a few hours, was absolutely enough. Kansas and Nebraska are close seconds.",

            "Stationed at Grand Forks for a couple of years. All you do in North Dakota is drink, make babies, or drink and make babies. I will say it's interesting to get drunk, golf with 40+ mph winds, and then have all of the prairie dogs (dak rats) come take your golf ball. Also blizzards are pretty cool. Went downtown one day and it was 80\u00b0 and the temp dropped to 0\u00b0 within the next 9-10 hours. You can't\u00a0 forget the real feel in the winter because of the wind chill at -60/-70. It's definitely a different beast to live there, especially as a single person.",

            "As someone that lived in Fargo, Grand Forks, and Bismark at various times, and as an alumni of University of North Dakota, I have to agree with most of the people here.  The parks are nice and Fargo is a neat little city.... but if you do find yourself in North Dakota, I recommend visiting the tree.\n\nWe do have one.\n\nSomewhere.\n\nIn seriousness, I like ND, but it's really not a touristy state.  It is a place that I would, without question, *live* there again, but I would never *visit.*",

Too far to go, nothing of interest (that I\u2019m aware of) when you get there./\n\nI've visited 49 states in the Union and North Dakota is the only one I've never set foot in, for the very reason you stated.

We were vacationing in SD once and on our way back I was like 'hey, should we pop up to ND just to say we've been there?' \n\nThe consensus was \"eh..\"\n\nI'm sure TR Ntl Park is amazing. I do wish we'd seen that.  But wow, SD packs a punch. The Badlands are like a whole 'nother planet, and there's so much to see in Black Hills... \n\nIf you have to choose a Dakota to visit, SD is where it's at. If you have time to visit both, add in ND and prioritize TR Ntl Park.",

Outdoorsy shit for sure, but will definitely go back for a longer trip to check out more",

Ironically, North Dakota has one of the most successful college hockey programs in history and also has cornfields but there is simply no way a person drove through there on the route you mentioned.",

I\u2019ve seen natives treated like dirt here and there\u2019s a reason why so many native girls go missing around this area.

            "Not Mr. CoachCP but I am from there -\n\nWell into my third decade and I don't really see myself going back to FW. I know they have been working to improve the downtown but at the end of the day, it's just kind of a *giant suburb*. It's great if you know people who love it there - I get nostalgic sometimes - but I'll tell you why I feel this way. \n\nI've lived long-term in about 6 states (but two of those are IL and MO). Living outside of St. Louis I was able to take the metro to downtown and see Cardinals games; and I've also  lived in the extreme north of the USA next to the Canadian border, where I can volunteer at a ranch, or go shooting every afternoon, or go dogsledding in the winter (maybe next year!) . FW does not have the culture of a St. Louis or the adventure of North Dakota. \n\nIt's just incredibly bland. Good property values, lots of different jobs, great place to raise a family, but just so incredibly bland. Please keep in mind, I am not a particularly \"interesting\" or \"high energy\" person myself. \n\nAnd I am probably going to sound a bit like a jerk, but a lot of the people there are just small-minded. They don't like new things, or new people. Their entire family lives down the street. Many have never even left the state. Half of these people will say they never would *want* to, the other half \"*hate it there*\" but don't have the nerve to leave. Complacency.  \n\nThat's just like, my opinion, though. Different strokes for different folks.",
            "That makes sense. Apparently North Dakota also has the least forest cover percentage of any state. I love forests so to me states like Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas aren't on the top of my list of states to visit. I'd love to visit other states with deserts and other great natural scenery like Arizona and Utah, but I already see enough farmland in the part of Pennsylvania I live in. It might be nice to visit one of these states to see unique states with unique culture though. I really enjoy visiting less visited states like West Virginia. Great place to take a road trip and go hiking."

            "If I ever have to step foot in Oklahoma again, I'll be pissed. Racist ass pieces of shits here. I have to warn my own troops about places and towns. One of the city council members got outed as part of the KKK. I'm Inupiaq but get confused as a hispanic and fuck. I hate these people. City official was telling me how much he hates gays. I am gay. Heard from another person that he wouldn't participate in the parade if the LGBT were in it as he'd want to run them over.\n\nI stopped going to the city meetings. I get having good public relations between the city and the military base, but I don't feel safe attending there anymore as I'm always attending by myself. If there's an emergency response that needs to happen? Fine, gotta focus on the response. But I don't care enough about the training or the networking more than my own well-being or my troops. Wearing the uniform keeps me somewhat safe, but what about when I'm not? How about if I never had put on the uniform at all? Fuck you Oklahomans that are bigoted pieces of shits.",

My ex lives in Oklahoma, so I guess that would be at the top of the list of places to avoid, but Oklahoma is a big state, so avoiding the ex would be easy. \n\nOutside of that, every state has something to see or do, and no real reason to avoid it in travel.",
            "It's hard to say. I've lived in a lot of different places growing up as an Army brat. I live in Oklahoma, love the people but hate the blast furnace hot summers. So for me probably someplace that is too hot. I have been to Hawaii but couldn't go back, the weather is just too hot.",

I've never been to Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Alaska, and Hawaii, but I live in New England, which is thousands of miles from all of them, ranging from 1260 miles to Mississippi all the way to around 6000 miles to Hawaii.

There\u2019s no chance I\u2019d ever need to be in Oklahoma.   The same for Mississippi. \n\nFrom New England, I\u2019m eyeing the April eclipse.  I can see hopping in a rental car and driving as far as Arkansas to get sunny weather.  I\u2019d otherwise have no reason to ever be in Arkansas.",

            "Even Mississippi has the gulf coast which is pretty has some nice towns like Ocean Springs. WV has the mountains and natural beauty. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s a toss up between Oklahoma, Kansas and Indiana. Boring flat grasslands with a lot of poverty, no thanks.",
            "California. Moved from Alaska to Oklahoma in 2015 and flying isn't my favorite thing. My doctor gave me a little sample pack of Valium so that I could easily sleep on the red eye segment of my flight. I arrive in California and TSA finds my single pill in a small blister pack and detain me for much too long asking me the dumbest questions. \n\"Who gave you this?\"\n\"Where's your prescription?\"\nLong story short I left LAX without my pill and make it to my destination. A couple of months later my dad gets a letter for me from the California court system. I had apparently missed court for a single pill that was given to me by a doctor. I did have the little sheet with all the drug information along with my other medications, and I showed them this when I was stopped. It even had my name on it and a list of refills I got that day. \n     I should also mention that while I was traversing LAX in the middle of the night I was in an oddly empty corridor on the way to my terminal. Turning the corner I was shocked to see a transgender individual intravenously injecting something in a corner. Fuckin LA. Got on my plane. \n     The moral of my story is that you can shoot up at the airport in LA and it's even on to use the bathroom in the street... But you better not have any prescribed medications at the airport. \n\nI will never go back to California.",
            "Well, I've been to every State except Hawaii and I plan on checking that off my list soon, but there are certainly States I wouldn't *revisit.* I never actually stopped anywhere in Kansas or Oklahoma other than maybe a tollbooth or gas station. I don't really know why I'd go back other than just passing through. Most States have something of interest even if overall the State is kind of a bore, though. Even the Dakotas have a few National Parks and some beautiful scenery, though most of the Dakotas are painfully boring (and windy).",

I used to work  traveling all over the country and South America.  Postponed as much as I could and I was young and dumb. I did not bother to pay a lawyer  like 2 grand to go on my behalf.

The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains are gorgeous, perhaps surprisingly so. I only use the word surprisingly because both Missouri and Arkansas are frequently lumped together with the rest of the flyover states in the plains by the rest of the country. \n\nSpeaking of the Ouachita Mountains, likewise with Arkansas, they are also the reason why southeast Oklahoma is similarly gorgeous to a surprising degree.

The toll system confused the hell out of us when we drove through Oklahoma with our son several years ago. We've never experienced anything like it. \n\nFirst the woman in the toll booth asked us where we were going. It seemed very weird that she would want to engage in pleasant chit-chat about our trip, but fine -- we told her we were headed to New Mexico. Then she clarified that she wanted to know which exit we'd be taking. We hadn't decided, because we were going to look for a restaurant along the way. So she charged us for one of the farther exits, gave us a receipt, and told us to keep it so we could get a refund if we took an earlier exit. \n\nIt was so complicated and bizarre that later on we kept asking each other if it had really happened. Until now the three of us were almost convinced we had shared some sort of hallucination. Thank you for confirming that this is reality in Oklahoma.",

If you live somewhere like Wyoming or Arkansas or Alaska you can buy somewhere cheap in your early 20s but those places are not as desirable. In my experience with Hawaii where they get you is every day prices. Gas is 2-3 dollars more than mainland, good luck on jewelry there, foods are different where you are as well, parking gets expensive fast. I call the every day prices in Hawaii the Hawaii tax.",

And Google images just reaffirms this notion. I'd see better waterfal gorges and caves in NY, I'd see prettier mountains throughout the Adirondacks and the other parts of Appalachia outside of Arkansas.

Texas has CBD w/THC and a very limited medical program (only 3 dispensaries).  On top of that, [according to what I read] Oklahoma requires an Oklahoma ID and additional proof of residency (utility bill, etc.), plus paying $100/medical or $200/recreational for a card that\u2019s valid for 2 years.  \n\nhttps://disa.com/marijuana-legality-by-state",

I went from Taos NM to Denver to visit some friends and figured I'd spend a few days driving west through CO to get to Utah which is where I really wanted to explore, but my \"few days\" in CO turned into over two weeks. I looked up CO's scenic byways and mapped out a route that hit like four or five of them, and was totally blown away. The most epic scenery I've seen in my entire life by a mile, and I've seen *a lot* of epic scenery in my 32 years, all over the world. I knew CO was supposed to be beautiful, but it took me totally off guard.\n\nThe Eastern Sierras are the only thing that compares in my opinion, but in the Eastern Sierras you usually have to backpack at least 10 miles to get those kinds of views. In CO you can just drive right up to them. Unreal.",

It's weird.\n\nEdit : also, if you think the solution to your problems is everyone moving..... no wonder Colorado has such a high % of German population\n\n\nEdit: hold the fuck up bro you've seen the fentanyl addicts on the side of i-25 too? I THOUGHT THAT WAS PART OF THE FLAVOUR OF COLOURADO",
            "It is exactly like most other states in the U.S. Love the mountains, this has nothin to do with defenseless environment. This is the only state I've lived in which was adamantly defensive about how fantastic everything was. Can't laugh at the effectiveness of tourism propaganda. They call California shit for raising prices, call Texas fucking redneck, call Kansas backwards losers then admit they'be only lived in Colorado. \n\nOnly thing that gets me is this weird thing they have for being dicks to anyone who moves here, and any problem is viewed as some kind of outsiders nightmare. \n\nSpiritual pangolin kind of summed it up for me - \n\"so move then?

            "My best travel story is to Delaware.\n\nMy lovely, idiot, European friend bought a ticket to come visit me in NC. He flew from Boston to Charlotte. Perfect. I ask him a few days before he leaves, what time does he need to be at the airport and this dude drops that his return flight is out of NEW YORK CITY. I asked him how he planned on getting there and he thought I could \"just drop him off.\" He insisted he knew that was like, 12 hours away but I don't believe him for a second. I think he looked at a map and thought they were close enough.\n\nSo anyway, our only financially feasible option was to take a public bus. Which in his German mind, was totally fine. But I knew it was about to be bad. We get on a 14 hour bus ride to NYC owned by a Chinese bussing company that had no toilet. We rode that thing to Delaware until this one lady went up to the driver and said, \"IF YOU DON'T STOP THIS BUS NOW, IMMA DROP MY PANTS AND SHIT HERE AT YOUR FEET!\" \n\nSo we stopped in Delaware to use the restroom. My friend and I bought all the air fresheners at the stop and distributed them to passengers because of how bad the bus smelled, which turned out to be a horrible idea. We should have bought all of just one scent, not a mix. Because then it smelled like sweaty people, farts, cherry, lemon and pine. \n\nWe were all glad to get off that thing. And my friend learned all about the American transportation system and a hard lesson in how big this country ACTUALLY is. Thank you, Delaware for a great pee.",

The jellyfish , little ones glowed when you smacked the water with an oar and the bird life was incredible. When we were little my dad called us his muskrats or his seagulls cause we were always hungry and always near or on the water.

So I do. \n\nLetter comes back saying \u201cOK plead guilty of possession, pay $300 fine then $150 court fee and we\u2019re good\u201d which sounds better than showing up for sure so I go parade my unexpected win to my mom saying she was right. $450 is a lot but better than far away court right? She goes \u201cwrite them another letter saying you\u2019re a poor college student and can\u2019t pay that kind of money reasonably\u201d. So I do. \n\nLetter comes back saying \u201cOK plead guilty, sign this paper saying you promise to NEVER do this again for at least 7 years. Then we\u2019re good.\u201d  I didn\u2019t need mommy to tell me to sign that shit an mail it in!! Never heard another thing after 15ish years. \n\nThe girls flew in and went to court. Cost them a fuck load of money despite one of their moms being a flight attendant.

Some will extradite even for relatively minor offenses and then charge the defendant a butt load of money for the extradition costs, am in Springfield MO and heard and believe they're bad about this. One of the biggest industries in the state of Missouri is corrections, they get reimbursed a lot of money by the taxpayers for every day they house someone in jail. Putting/housing folks in jail is one of this city's leading sources of revenue. They just opened a new 90+ million dollar county jail a few years ago and a big chunk of it is devoted to housing federal defendants/prisoners, the feds pay more per day than the state. Same time got pulled over with an active warrant in a certain county here going to see a gf's family, she was driving. Cop mentioned you know you have a warrant in X-county ? Yep but they won't extradite unless it's within a 50mi radius, so he bid us drive safe and on we went.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMore commentary, one saying associated with the state of Missouri, is come on vacation... leave on probation and that's for real. Corrections is a huge industry here. Remember being in the old county jail here for bs charges that were later dismissed, they had the county jail so overcrowded it was bursting at the seams, so they started making deals with little county jails all over the area to house people, they'd split part of the per diem they got from the state with these little county jails to house people for them awaiting trial.\u00a0 \u00a0 They actually sent me to be housed in a county 2+ hours away ! That's how wide this was. Purely about profit, for them and the hosting jails, needless to say the new jail is now overcrowded too.",

You see, the city was established in the area located near the confluence of the Kansas River and the Missouri River. The city name and the river name were inspired by the Kanza Native American tribe who had lived in the area. It was originally named just Kansas (no \"city\"). Then, the state of Kansas came along, and this required them to be differentiated somehow, so Kansas CITY it became, and it sat completely within Missouri. Meanwhile in Kansas (state), there was a major dispute about where the state capital should be located. At one point there were actually two Kansas state capitals, but depending on what side of the political divide over slavery you sat on, you recognized one or the other. For a bit more info on that see this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecompton\\_Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecompton_Constitution).",

We used to be a purple state, but we're gerrymandered to hell and they're trying to make it harder for the citizens to change the Missouri constitution ahead of the abortion issue that hopefully will be on the ballot in November.  The people are nice, usually, but sometimes it's just to your face because that's what is polite.  If you go to KC, STL, or Columbia those are our blue areas. I liked living in Columbia. If you're old and white you'll camouflage in pretty well and no one will bother you if you don't talk about politics. Honestly, I'm transgender and I've never had an issue with people in public spaces (some weird looks sometimes), but I know I've been very lucky, and I won't go further south to test my luck.  Our government would prefer that I simply don't exist.  They almost banned meds for transgender adults. Abortion isn't legal here, so while you're talking about retiring, if you have any other family that would also be moving, consider that. We also have a high maternal mortality rate.  \n\nWe were in a severe drought most of last year (if not all) and were already in a mild-moderate drought this year. It continues to get hotter here every year.  Our summers are muggy and hot (90-100\u00b0F) with very few break days. Your skin will get sticky just from stepping outside sometimes. And if you're going to be outside, drink lots of water/ Gatorade and wear sunscreen, because heat sickness and heat stroke can sneak up on you. Our winters can have a lot of snow and be very cold(sub-0), though this has lessened the last few years (part of why we have a drought issue)\nThis year we're going to have cicadas, they're the worst. \n\nOur state has some really pretty places to go see. There's several caves and usually lots of nature stuff to do near the caves so you can make a day or weekend trip pretty easily. If you like lakes, don't go to the Lake of the Ozarks, go to Pomme de Terre or Truman. I don't particularly care for Branson, but a lot of other people do. Dixie stampede and silver dollar city are the standard things to do there. If you like gambling at all, our casinos have to be on a boat and that limits where you can do that.  We have a lot of Meth, especially in rural places and Springfield. But that's generally not an issue as long as you don't live next to a meth house/ trailer.",

            "> Again, Presentism, judging a modern set of people for actions taken well in that people's past. Your argument is invalid.\n\nIt seems you have comprehension issues. Black people understood racism long, long before it was called racism. It doesn't matter that Mormons didn't see anything wrong with it back then. **Black people knew it was wrong - and we were the ones who were the victims of it.**\n\nYour complaint of 'presentism' is invalid, as it implies that there was some kind of general agreement that Mormon support of slavery was acceptable. Guess what - victims of racism were aware of it and didn't like it in the 1600s, 1700s, 1800s, and 1900s. Still not good in the 2000s. We black people reject your fake argument that 'it was OK then', just because it was more common.\n\n**It was not.**\n\nWife-beating was very common in the past too, would you argue that was 'OK', just because it happened a lot? And what about women of the past who would have had a lot to say about domestic violence being wrong?\n\n> Yea it's so bad translation services are offered at church and and they're welcomed from any country with open arms. the horror!\n\nStraw man. I never claimed or argued that LDS is a white-only church. My point is that it was built on a foundation of racism and its early leaders promoted slavery. Until 1978, Mormons asserted that the God cursed black people, and they must be forever slaves.\n\nWe understand that you are forced to defend your religion. But you are trying to defend the indefensible.\n\n> You mean like the Jewish people claim to be the blessed people of God and all that? You're mixing up religions.\n\nNo, I mean the old Mormon scripture that claimed that white people were blessed, and black people were evil and cursed. [Stop pretending that wasn't the original teaching.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-genesis-of-a-churchs-stand-on-race/2012/02/22/gIQAQZXyfR_story.html) You're fooling nobody here.\n\nIt's well-known that the Church of Latter-Day Saints [taught totally racist doctrine about black people](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/jmormhist.41.3.22) until 1978, when the pressure of bad publicity led to a 'revelation from god' and suddenly black people were allowed to hold positions in the church when previously they had not been allowed to since they suffered from ['the curse of Ham' and 'the curse of Cain'](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Question:_How_did_the_%22curse_of_Ham%22_or_%22curse_of_Cain%22_become_associated_with_Mormonism%3F).\n\nSince you don't appear to know, I can tell you that once the LDS Church settled in Missouri, the church became wholeheartedly pro-slavery. [Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, taught that slavery of black people was Biblical.](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-oliver-cowdery-circa-9-april-1836/2)\n\nHis successor, Brigham Young, claimed to be neutral on slavery, yet on moving the Church to Utah, campaigned vigorously to legalise slavery in the Territory. Bitter that he failed, he continuously proclaimed that slavery was ordained by God, and that God would ensure that abolition of slavery would fail. So he was well aware of the arguments against slavery, yet he supported it.\n\nThis long-dead mf even promoted the enslavement of Native Americans. \n\nBrigham Young spoke for many Mormons in 1863 when he commented: \"One portion of the country wish to raise their ... black slaves and the other wish to free them, and apparently to almost worship them.... Who cares? ... [Ham will continue to be the servant of servants, as the Lord has decreed, until the curse is removed.\"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Journal_of_Discourses/Volume_10/Necessity_for_Watchfulness,_etc.)\n\nClearly, Brigham Young was on the pro-slavery side of the Civil War. You can go sit down with your BS assertion that slavery was somehow OK in Brigham Young's time. He knew black people wanted to be free. Plenty of people pointed out that slavery was wrong. Young's argument was that your God supported it, he quoted scripture to support it, and many Mormons secretly believe it still.\n\nIf they don't, then how come when they knock at my door proselytising in pairs, they can never explain to me what has changed, and why?",

Listen to commenters who visit for the NFL draft or NCAA event or conference championship. Look at the rave reviews after the Super Bowl. Everything is walkable - maybe except ironically the Indy 500 but you're tailgating that! I also speak in comparison - I work professionally in sports, and I've been to matches and things like media says all over the country. Indy matches right with the best of them. \n\nLet's say your not into sports events but like outdoors stuff. Indiana is not better than your idealistic states. But it's way better than Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, etc...\n\nLet's say you don't want to be able to travel to the various areas of the state. Indiana has highways throughout going every direction.

            "There aren't many states that don't have incredibly liberal pockets and incredibly conservative pockets. I live in Arlington, which is just an hour above Seattle, and it's a bunch of backwater hick rednecks here. There's only a handful of towns in each state which truly feels different from living in other towns, but otherwise, no matter where you are in the states, you are either five minutes away from progressives or five minutes away from traditionalists.\n\nAs for weather, I fucking hate hot places, but weather in the States is inconsistent. You can literally suffer from heatwave in Idaho and then have it snow for a good ten minutes the next day in Idaho. Which literally happened. And still happens. But if you go up to Maine, you'll get warm rain in one town and then snow in the very next town over. The more middle northern states are where it really does stay a little consistently cold and then death by hypothermia, and then in the South, it's between hot and imminent death by dehydration for getting out of any building or car, and you're lucky if your apartment has AC.\n\nThere is also sort of an American behavior scale, but to be honest, even if people aren't a bunch of bigots, there is a HUGE amount of assholes. Get off the computer and go outside, assholes will ruin your day. Get on the computer, assholes will still ruin your day. There's pretty much zero consequences and free dopamine for acting like a complete cuckazoid bully at the moment. The dating game is also incredibly awful in the States, and it circles back to the asshole crisis. You have dudes that will hit their ladies, and you have ladies that will accuse their dudes of rape, and then vice versa. If you're gay, you're going to be bullied for being too gay or not gay enough, even though it's literally a sexuality and not a culture, but bigots will claim that it's a huge way of life, since other bigots treat it as such. If you try to date in the black community, you will be judged for literally every single little thing you do, from if you put a seatbelt on, to how many chips you grab out of a bag. If you try to date in the Mexican community, you're going to be hounded for not being Mexican enough. If you try to date in the white community, her parents are always going to roast the shit out of you for your career and if you're poor or not, and her dad will definitely threaten to shoot you, guaranteed. And if you're trying to date in the Asian community, you will face all these criticisms, especially from your girlfriend. This is not to mention how radically political people are at the moment, where despite being left leaning or right leaning, both sides are incredibly racist and biased, but come up with excuses as to how their version of racism or sexism is fine because of a past event in their life or because they believe they are part of a minority group. Rednecks have bullied people for so long that people have now taken on redneck behaviors as a defense mechanism, which baffles me.\n\nAll in all, it really doesn't matter which state you live in, unless if it's Florida, California, or Texas, due to how wild their laws and populations are. Wherever you stop, you will be shown how great the States are, and how awful the States are. There are so many good people and so many pleasant days to have in the city or the country. And there are so many assholes and god awful weather that you wish you would be kidnapped by aliens.\n\nalabama",

Now that I'm not dealing with the general public face-to-face (I'm a cook now) it hasn't been as bad but I've definitely still caught shit for my identity in places where I've been open about it. Coworkers \"jokingly\" calling me slurs and one lady who told me I was mentally ill, on an \"evil path\" and that I needed to find God lol. I can't really rely on other coworkers/bosses to help me in those situations because these behaviors are pretty commonplace here and most people I've met don't really see a problem with it. I'm less open about my identity in public now. \n\nThis has not been my experience in most other states I've been to. Homophobia and transphobia for sure still exist, but in a lot of other places it's not so socially acceptable. \n\nAccess to gender affirming healthcare has also been more difficult in Florida. For me, just being able to sign my informed consent forms was a month-long wait and hours of driving.\n\nAll in all, I haven't had any physically violent experiences yet, but I can definitely feel that I'm unwelcome.

            "It's not just any *single* law. It's the effect of something like 6 overlapping laws. And even on the surface, some of them may not even sound so bad, but when you read the wording, that's when you realize jar how bad it out. Anyway, here's a bit of a summary of the path between a few of them:\n\n- No drag performances anywhere kids could be. Kids don't even need to be there for it to be an offense. Just the possibility for a kid to be present. \n\n- a drag performance is sneakily defined as anything where gender nonconformance is on display (so it includes a person simply being trans where someone could see them) \n\n- trans people effectively banned from public restrooms, turning them into sex offenders (now remember, this includes places like roadside rest stops, restaurants, museums, theme parks, beaches, hotels, etc.) \n\n- concerned family members living in Florida can report incidents of kids being exposed to drag performances and demand rehoming them\n\nThere are some other \"glue\" laws in play too. So anyway, effectively, combining all of it, if i go to a restroom while at the airport after landing in Florida, I've already broken a few laws as a transgender person and could find myself charged as a sex offender. Furthermore, since I would have set foot in the state since the laws took effect, my extended family can report any incidents of my kid being around us at any time as an offense, even after I've left the state, and they have it codified into law that they can petition to take custody of our child. That then gets recorded and the next time any of us set foot in Florida, they can have our kids taken away and immediately placed in their care.\n\nNow fair enough, is any of this actually going to happen? Hopefully not. But I don't want to be the one that this happens to first.",
            "I've been keeping up with Florida laws, and I don't know if it's explicitly illegal JUST to be trans, but there are a lot of anti-trans laws designed to make it harder.\n\nFor instance, they're trying to put a law in place that allows them to take your drivers license if you're trans and it displays your preferred pronouns. However, they're ALSO trying to make it illegal to change your driver's license. So, if your license reflects your preferred pronouns? Well, you're just fucked.\n\nAnd really, I doubt they're going to stop there because Ron is absolutely obsessed with trans and gay people. So, when someone says it's illegal to live in Florida, I don't think it's LITERALLY illegal, but it might as well be with Ron intentionally targeting them like this and wanting to take away things that are necessary for them to live there.\n\nIt's scary to live there as a trans person. \n\nHere's a source:\n\n[https://www.axios.com/local/tampa-bay/2024/02/23/florida-transgender-drivers-license-bill-hb-1639](https://www.axios.com/local/tampa-bay/2024/02/23/florida-transgender-drivers-license-bill-hb-1639)",

The market wasn\u2019t that crazy aside from the fact that our price range was low for the area. We were looking at wood frame houses in south Florida, which is so dumb, but we were priced out of rentals, are basically stuck in the area until my mom is ready to move back north with us (when my dad passes). We didn\u2019t think we would be able to afford anything else. That place was wood frame in a neighborhood with a lot of \u201cFlorida man\u201d types, but had a massive yard which made it almost seem worth it. After that, we saw a listing for a place with no floors that only mentioned on one site that they would offer a $17k credit for floors and then they came down on the price, but it only showed up on one site. When we looked at it, it had a pretty obvious roach problem, but it was the big ones (which are *terrifying,* but easier to get rid of), it was painted a bunch of random colors and the cement floors made it look like a construction zone. It was too much for most people to look past and it was part of an estate where the executor wouldn\u2019t sell to investors. She actually ended up being one of my fianc\u00e9\u2019s clients , but we didn\u2019t find out until saw the names on the paperwork (she later told him about the investor thing). It\u2019s not long term because it\u2019s FL and we\u2019re not complete idiots, but it\u2019s a decent short term investment and it\u2019s concrete so it won\u2019t blow away in a hurricane (hopefully). Painting and floors (the ones we got to pick out, a step up from squeaky flipper garbage) made such a difference and the roaches were long gone by the time we moved in. \n\nSo anyway, it was weird, but it worked out!

He basically worked some hippie lady\u2019s garden and lived in a tent.  \nHe eventually quit the gardening gig and got a a job working on a whale watching boat.  He was kind of a hired helper so to speak not like the guide but made comps from tips. He still lived in a tent. His brother was air force and based in anchorage and he started to spend summers in Alaska. He lived like a nomad and found a woman who was doing the same. They moved back and forth from Hawaii to Alaska. Winters in Hawaii and summers in Alaska.  He somehow saved a few bucks and bought a homestead in far north west Alaska close to the ocean.  They live there full time and he lives off grid and off what he gets from the land.  That\u2019s the story of my friend Matt.  He used to be the greatest guitar player I had ever seen and played 12 string acoustic while we drank cheap whiskey. He says he doesn\u2019t play much anymore but has been thinking about getting a guitar again.",

The only state I can honestly say I wouldn't make another trip to see is North Dakota. I saw the Teddy Roosevelt National Park, the bison, the badlands, and the ground hog towns.....really, that's all there is to see. Once, for a few hours, was absolutely enough.

There\u2019s no chance I\u2019d ever need to be in Oklahoma.   The same for Mississippi. \n\nFrom New England, I\u2019m eyeing the April eclipse.  I can see hopping in a rental car and driving as far as Arkansas to get sunny weather.  I\u2019d otherwise have no reason to ever be in Arkansas.",

My doctor gave me a little sample pack of Valium so that I could easily sleep on the red eye segment of my flight. I arrive in California and TSA finds my single pill in a small blister pack and detain me for much too long asking me the dumbest questions. \n\"Who gave you this?\"\n\"Where's your prescription?\"\nLong story short I left LAX without my pill and make it to my destination. A couple of months later my dad gets a letter for me from the California court system. I had apparently missed court for a single pill that was given to me by a doctor. I did have the little sheet with all the drug information along with my other medications, and I showed them this when I was stopped. It even had my name on it and a list of refills I got that day. \n     I should also mention that while I was traversing LAX in the middle of the night I was in an oddly empty corridor on the way to my terminal. Turning the corner I was shocked to see a transgender individual intravenously injecting something in a corner. Fuckin LA. Got on my plane. \n     The moral of my story is that you can shoot up at the airport in LA and it's even on to use the bathroom in the street... But you better not have any prescribed medications at the airport. \n\nI will never go back to California.",

There are even more sovereign citizens like Moorish Nobility. How many people know what a Wyoming plate even looks like?\n\nOn two different occasions I\u2019ve been within just a few miles of the border.

In places like Colorado, Nevada, Florida, New York, California, Arizona, Virginia, Washington, etc. you have a lot of 3 generation households and you are lucky to put a down payment on your house in mid to late 30s. If you live somewhere like Wyoming or Arkansas or Alaska you can buy somewhere cheap in your early 20s but those places are not as desirable. In my experience with Hawaii where they get you is every day prices. Gas is 2-3 dollars more than mainland, good luck on jewelry there, foods are different where you are as well, parking gets expensive fast. I call the every day prices in Hawaii the Hawaii tax.",
            "Alaska and Maine are both beautiful. Maine make a point to visit Acadia in particular, and Mount Katahdin if you're in shape for it. Alaska is also incredible, but far out of your way from the other states, so it's an unsurprising last if you're hitting most of them on a road trip.",

            "Well, the Hawaii system is to tax, and tax..and tax some more.\n\nHawaii would fail as a whole if tourism was greatly reduced.  It is Hawaii's number one source of income.\n\nA little over a year ago, we were vacationing on the Big Island.  Because of a canceled flight, Alaska paid for pax to stay in a hotel overnight.\n\nWe stayed at a mid level hotel and it was very expensive, $500/night.  But the kicker is that they have a bunch of tourist 'surcharges'.\n\nWe needed dinner and so hubby and I ordered a chicken salad and soda drinks.  The salad was pathetic and small.\n\nThat meal, delivery and tip and surcharges came to about $60.00!\n\nThis year, we are taking a June cruise to Alaska.  Alaska is also expensive, but nowhere near Hawaii's.",

We love to hike or trail run...also would want to see coastal towns and wildlife.\n\nWhen we fly we don't usually tent camp but cabins would be fine.  Or lodges, B&Bs, airbnbs, whatever...\n\nWe are definitely NOT cruise people.  I have a fat pile of miles on two different Oneworld airlines so we'd likely fly in on Alaska and would be able to pick a small destination beyond ANC for the same number of miles.",

            "I sometimes think it would be cool to visit all the states. I've already been to 36, including Alaska and Hawaii, so I'm well on my way. But man, Oklahoma... it really puts a cramp in the \"every state\" goal for me. It's so far away and inconvenient and seems really dull.\n\nI figure if I make it to the other 49 I might start considering visiting Oklahoma. I've only driven a little bit in Texas, so I guess I could combine the two to get a real visit there too.\n\nAnd agreed on South Dakota. Really didn't expect that state to be so amazing.",
            "There are a lot of public use cabins on the Kenai peninsula with a lot of different hiking trails, I recommend portage glacier trail and rainbow trail near beluga point on the way down to Homer/Seward. If I'm honest, the best way to maximize your time is to fly into ANC and rent a car to drive to the kenai, Denali and maybe Fairbanks. North Pole is a cool spot just outside of fairbanks. If you did want to use miles for another spot in Alaska, I'd say Juneau is a good place (I've never personally been there) because it's a rainforest and a different ecosystem/climate than a lot of Alaska. Lots of options but no matter what you choose, Alaska is handsdown the most beautiful state.",
            "Katmai rocks. If you can swing it, try to do a hike on the mountain. The stuff to do in camp is cool, and the bear viewing platform is cool but so crowded with massive cameras. \nKenai is cool, and the float down river is awesome, but if you get the time take, check out Homer. It\u2019s one of my favorite towns in Alaska. \nAs far as Native American museums, the Anchorage museum has an entire wing dedicated to many different indigenous cultures. \nOn your way to Denali, try to stop in Talkeetna, oh and also you can drive through Hatchers pass when you\u2019re going that way too. It\u2019s amazing.",
            "Glad to hear you're doing the fjords. Personally, I'd recommend spending extra time in Katmai and on the Peninsula then head the other direction on the next trip. Have a great time. Alaska is AMAZING!"

            "Been to 47. Only missing Maine, West Virginia, and South Dakota. Found charming things in every state.",
            "There aren't many states that don't have incredibly liberal pockets and incredibly conservative pockets. I live in Arlington, which is just an hour above Seattle, and it's a bunch of backwater hick rednecks here. There's only a handful of towns in each state which truly feels different from living in other towns, but otherwise, no matter where you are in the states, you are either five minutes away from progressives or five minutes away from traditionalists.\n\nAs for weather, I fucking hate hot places, but weather in the States is inconsistent. You can literally suffer from heatwave in Idaho and then have it snow for a good ten minutes the next day in Idaho. Which literally happened. And still happens. But if you go up to Maine, you'll get warm rain in one town and then snow in the very next town over. The more middle northern states are where it really does stay a little consistently cold and then death by hypothermia, and then in the South, it's between hot and imminent death by dehydration for getting out of any building or car, and you're lucky if your apartment has AC.\n\nThere is also sort of an American behavior scale, but to be honest, even if people aren't a bunch of bigots, there is a HUGE amount of assholes. Get off the computer and go outside, assholes will ruin your day. Get on the computer, assholes will still ruin your day. There's pretty much zero consequences and free dopamine for acting like a complete cuckazoid bully at the moment. The dating game is also incredibly awful in the States, and it circles back to the asshole crisis. You have dudes that will hit their ladies, and you have ladies that will accuse their dudes of rape, and then vice versa. If you're gay, you're going to be bullied for being too gay or not gay enough, even though it's literally a sexuality and not a culture, but bigots will claim that it's a huge way of life, since other bigots treat it as such. If you try to date in the black community, you will be judged for literally every single little thing you do, from if you put a seatbelt on, to how many chips you grab out of a bag. If you try to date in the Mexican community, you're going to be hounded for not being Mexican enough. If you try to date in the white community, her parents are always going to roast the shit out of you for your career and if you're poor or not, and her dad will definitely threaten to shoot you, guaranteed. And if you're trying to date in the Asian community, you will face all these criticisms, especially from your girlfriend. This is not to mention how radically political people are at the moment, where despite being left leaning or right leaning, both sides are incredibly racist and biased, but come up with excuses as to how their version of racism or sexism is fine because of a past event in their life or because they believe they are part of a minority group. Rednecks have bullied people for so long that people have now taken on redneck behaviors as a defense mechanism, which baffles me.\n\nAll in all, it really doesn't matter which state you live in, unless if it's Florida, California, or Texas, due to how wild their laws and populations are. Wherever you stop, you will be shown how great the States are, and how awful the States are. There are so many good people and so many pleasant days to have in the city or the country. And there are so many assholes and god awful weather that you wish you would be kidnapped by aliens.\n\nalabama",

I considered Missouri, but I\u2019d definitely end up in St. Louis at some point. I have a friend who lives in New Mexico. I like to hike and visit landmarks so a lot of the square western states like Wyoming, Arizona I\u2019ll end up at eventually. A buddy is building a home in Montana so I\u2019ll be there. I love the northeast sparse states like Vermont and Maine and currently live in the region so will likely visit. I was born in Florida so I\u2019ve been to the southeast states, and my family is from Kentucky so I\u2019ve been to Ohio, Indiana, WV as well.

It\u2019s absolutely beautiful on the coast, pretty towns (we especially loved Camden), green everywhere you look, Acadia National Park is breathtaking and killer seafood all over the place. Bangor was all right, the Stephen King vibes there are fun. Would go back to Maine in a heartbeat.",

The only time I heard Maine yotes sound like that they were trying to lure my dog away . When I looked around the break I saw a coyote in the road sounding like a little poodle. My dog seemed to know cause she didn\u2019t go see like she does with strange dogs. Just stayed behind the break.",
            "So freaking sad. My father's side of the family is from Maine, and they could tell you the same exact thing.",
            "We picked about 200 off us when we sat down for lunch on a log beside a trail.  Thats happened a few times in other states (over my entire life) though so i wasn't blaming Maine alone for it.",

            "That's probably it! Totally, right? It's such a beautiful drive! And we had amazing weather too. Middlebury is a stop on the highway. It was an adorable small town. \n\nI'm a California native and I think my home state is maybe the most beautiful state, with all the variety: fun big cities, quaint little beach towns, the plains and farmland in the center of the state, the deserts, the mountain ranges full of fir trees, the Redwoods and the rocky coastline of Northern California, and so on. \n\nBut I absolutely fell in love with New England during the two years I lived in Quincy. I like to joke that God lives on the coast of Maine. At least during the summers. Part of me seriously wanted to stay in one the adorable little Port towns along the Maine coast forever. \n\nI also think Boston is America's most beautiful big city, and I say that even though I also think my home city of Los Angeles is beautiful, so I was stunned seeing an even more beautiful city.\n\nBut Santa Barbara is still my favorite small city in America. :)"

            "I will never want to even be near Idaho. About 10 years ago a friend (white male) and I (black male) embarked on a road trip to the Midwest from California for a friends wedding. We were in Idaho all of 15 minutes when we were pulled over by their hwy patrol. They administered a \u201csobriety\u201d test by having us tilt our heads back with our eyes closed. They claimed that eye movements indicated we had been using drugs. With no further evidence I was charged with a dui and amphetamine use, even though I\u2019ve never used drugs. They searched our car and found nothing but claimed I was admitting guilt by how I was STANDING w/ my hands together. I spent a year in their county jail fighting the case. When going to arraignment their DA suggested my bail be set at 50k, I could\u2019ve easily made bail but the judge set my bail for 500k. My friend spent 3 months in custody even though they found weed in his bag and he had an extensive criminal record. His mother was an attorney in his home state and she hired him the best lawyer in the area we were in. My family couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer so my friend gave me all of his notes from his lawyer to give to my public defender so we would be given the same level of legal representation. My public defender refused to do anything I asked, so while my friend was going home I was being held. I had never been in any trouble with the legal system. Not until my family was able to come up with 15k to pay the same lawyer my friend had was I able to get proper representation and gain my freedom. Prior to that I spent every day being threatened by Latino gang members and white \u201csupremacists\u201d as the only black personal in my pod. I was released to return in 5 months for sentencing. When I returned and had to spend a couple days in Idaho I was terrified to even leave my hotel for anything as I didn\u2019t want to be attacked by the racist residents of the town nor get harassed by the police. FUCK IDAHO",
            "There aren't many states that don't have incredibly liberal pockets and incredibly conservative pockets. I live in Arlington, which is just an hour above Seattle, and it's a bunch of backwater hick rednecks here. There's only a handful of towns in each state which truly feels different from living in other towns, but otherwise, no matter where you are in the states, you are either five minutes away from progressives or five minutes away from traditionalists.\n\nAs for weather, I fucking hate hot places, but weather in the States is inconsistent. You can literally suffer from heatwave in Idaho and then have it snow for a good ten minutes the next day in Idaho. Which literally happened. And still happens. But if you go up to Maine, you'll get warm rain in one town and then snow in the very next town over. The more middle northern states are where it really does stay a little consistently cold and then death by hypothermia, and then in the South, it's between hot and imminent death by dehydration for getting out of any building or car, and you're lucky if your apartment has AC.\n\nThere is also sort of an American behavior scale, but to be honest, even if people aren't a bunch of bigots, there is a HUGE amount of assholes. Get off the computer and go outside, assholes will ruin your day. Get on the computer, assholes will still ruin your day. There's pretty much zero consequences and free dopamine for acting like a complete cuckazoid bully at the moment. The dating game is also incredibly awful in the States, and it circles back to the asshole crisis. You have dudes that will hit their ladies, and you have ladies that will accuse their dudes of rape, and then vice versa. If you're gay, you're going to be bullied for being too gay or not gay enough, even though it's literally a sexuality and not a culture, but bigots will claim that it's a huge way of life, since other bigots treat it as such. If you try to date in the black community, you will be judged for literally every single little thing you do, from if you put a seatbelt on, to how many chips you grab out of a bag. If you try to date in the Mexican community, you're going to be hounded for not being Mexican enough. If you try to date in the white community, her parents are always going to roast the shit out of you for your career and if you're poor or not, and her dad will definitely threaten to shoot you, guaranteed. And if you're trying to date in the Asian community, you will face all these criticisms, especially from your girlfriend. This is not to mention how radically political people are at the moment, where despite being left leaning or right leaning, both sides are incredibly racist and biased, but come up with excuses as to how their version of racism or sexism is fine because of a past event in their life or because they believe they are part of a minority group. Rednecks have bullied people for so long that people have now taken on redneck behaviors as a defense mechanism, which baffles me.\n\nAll in all, it really doesn't matter which state you live in, unless if it's Florida, California, or Texas, due to how wild their laws and populations are. Wherever you stop, you will be shown how great the States are, and how awful the States are. There are so many good people and so many pleasant days to have in the city or the country. And there are so many assholes and god awful weather that you wish you would be kidnapped by aliens.\n\nalabama",

            "The problem with the US is that every state is like its own little country up until it\u2019s not, and the rules are fairly inconsistent from state to state. If it were a really serious crime (for example, murders or bank robbery), the police in California will send a message out to other states to be on the lookout for you. You will probably be caught eventually, especially if there\u2019s a statewide manhunt for you. \n\n But like, unpaid parking tickets or even something more serious like vandalism can also result in a warrant. In those case, the police are not going to bother hunting you down (too expensive) but if you happen to fall into their laps by other means (say you get pulled over for speeding in Oregon), the Oregon police officer will see a warrant out for your arrest.  \n\nThey\u2019ll send a message to California saying they caught you, and ask if California wants to have you extradited back to their jurisdiction. From there it depends a lot on what the California police wants to do. Sometimes California will ask to have you extradited from anywhere in the country. Sometimes they\u2019ll only ask for neighboring states. Sometimes the offense is so minor they won\u2019t even bother. \n\nYMMV here but that\u2019s the basic gist of it. The tldr is: yeah states really do be that weird.",

There are two options: A) if the bond is big enough, they might transport you themselves to collect it or B) They'll hold you for some amount of time to allow California to respond to collection. \n\nThey're not gonna bother with all the costs of sending someone back on a 500usd bond; and it's unlikely California will send someone to pick you up for something so small. So they'll probably just get a release notifier. If not (e.g. you're a murderer), they arrange transport or hold you for pickup back to the proper jurisdiction.",

The fact that people coexist in the same physical space doesn\u2019t imply a lack of racial tensions or a lack of racist policies. The opposite is also true.

When I get the Maine trip done I'm going to try to do several of those states/provinces together.\n\nI've been to Hawaii several times but it's so commercialized that it's not really my favorite.

Want a reminder of what everyone was doing culturally five years ago..? Visit Idaho. Want a reminder of what everyone was doing politically fifty years ago..? Yep.",
            "I will never want to even be near Idaho. About 10 years ago a friend (white male) and I (black male) embarked on a road trip to the Midwest from California for a friends wedding. We were in Idaho all of 15 minutes when we were pulled over by their hwy patrol. They administered a \u201csobriety\u201d test by having us tilt our heads back with our eyes closed. They claimed that eye movements indicated we had been using drugs. With no further evidence I was charged with a dui and amphetamine use, even though I\u2019ve never used drugs. They searched our car and found nothing but claimed I was admitting guilt by how I was STANDING w/ my hands together. I spent a year in their county jail fighting the case. When going to arraignment their DA suggested my bail be set at 50k, I could\u2019ve easily made bail but the judge set my bail for 500k. My friend spent 3 months in custody even though they found weed in his bag and he had an extensive criminal record. His mother was an attorney in his home state and she hired him the best lawyer in the area we were in. My family couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer so my friend gave me all of his notes from his lawyer to give to my public defender so we would be given the same level of legal representation. My public defender refused to do anything I asked, so while my friend was going home I was being held. I had never been in any trouble with the legal system. Not until my family was able to come up with 15k to pay the same lawyer my friend had was I able to get proper representation and gain my freedom. Prior to that I spent every day being threatened by Latino gang members and white \u201csupremacists\u201d as the only black personal in my pod. I was released to return in 5 months for sentencing. When I returned and had to spend a couple days in Idaho I was terrified to even leave my hotel for anything as I didn\u2019t want to be attacked by the racist residents of the town nor get harassed by the police. FUCK IDAHO",
            "Idaho is filled with the dumbest, inbred, hillbilly fucks on earth. I have to drive through every summer to visit my mother in the Midwest. They actively hate Washington state residents because our governor (correctly) called them out when our state had to pay to provide medical services to their troglodyte citizens who refused to wear masks or get the vaccine during the pandemic and came to our state for life-saving treatment and we continue to pay to provide obstetric services for their citizens who have the most restrictive ban on family planning in the nation.  I carry every firearm I own loaded when I travel through their white shite supremacist hell.",
            "Idaho. In fact, the eastern half of the state I currently live in would be rolled up right in there. Not the kind of place you go if you fall into certain groups. Also I have no desire to ever step foot in my home state of Missouri ever ever again.",
            "There aren't many states that don't have incredibly liberal pockets and incredibly conservative pockets. I live in Arlington, which is just an hour above Seattle, and it's a bunch of backwater hick rednecks here. There's only a handful of towns in each state which truly feels different from living in other towns, but otherwise, no matter where you are in the states, you are either five minutes away from progressives or five minutes away from traditionalists.\n\nAs for weather, I fucking hate hot places, but weather in the States is inconsistent. You can literally suffer from heatwave in Idaho and then have it snow for a good ten minutes the next day in Idaho. Which literally happened. And still happens. But if you go up to Maine, you'll get warm rain in one town and then snow in the very next town over. The more middle northern states are where it really does stay a little consistently cold and then death by hypothermia, and then in the South, it's between hot and imminent death by dehydration for getting out of any building or car, and you're lucky if your apartment has AC.\n\nThere is also sort of an American behavior scale, but to be honest, even if people aren't a bunch of bigots, there is a HUGE amount of assholes. Get off the computer and go outside, assholes will ruin your day. Get on the computer, assholes will still ruin your day. There's pretty much zero consequences and free dopamine for acting like a complete cuckazoid bully at the moment. The dating game is also incredibly awful in the States, and it circles back to the asshole crisis. You have dudes that will hit their ladies, and you have ladies that will accuse their dudes of rape, and then vice versa. If you're gay, you're going to be bullied for being too gay or not gay enough, even though it's literally a sexuality and not a culture, but bigots will claim that it's a huge way of life, since other bigots treat it as such. If you try to date in the black community, you will be judged for literally every single little thing you do, from if you put a seatbelt on, to how many chips you grab out of a bag. If you try to date in the Mexican community, you're going to be hounded for not being Mexican enough. If you try to date in the white community, her parents are always going to roast the shit out of you for your career and if you're poor or not, and her dad will definitely threaten to shoot you, guaranteed. And if you're trying to date in the Asian community, you will face all these criticisms, especially from your girlfriend. This is not to mention how radically political people are at the moment, where despite being left leaning or right leaning, both sides are incredibly racist and biased, but come up with excuses as to how their version of racism or sexism is fine because of a past event in their life or because they believe they are part of a minority group. Rednecks have bullied people for so long that people have now taken on redneck behaviors as a defense mechanism, which baffles me.\n\nAll in all, it really doesn't matter which state you live in, unless if it's Florida, California, or Texas, due to how wild their laws and populations are. Wherever you stop, you will be shown how great the States are, and how awful the States are. There are so many good people and so many pleasant days to have in the city or the country. And there are so many assholes and god awful weather that you wish you would be kidnapped by aliens.\n\nalabama",
            "I live in Idaho, which is a beautiful state, but....... we are a backward state. We have the strictest abortion laws. In fact, doctors can get arrested if they abort a baby to save the mom's life. Extremely high suicide rates. Everyone seems to hate LGBTQ+ people, especially Transgender peeps. Idaho is even trying to restrict live Drag Queen performances. During a school board meeting, a ton of parents got absolutely horrific when they were discussing the use of pronouns, which they are against.Some parents actually believe that the use of pronouns can influence their children just by sitting next to them in school like a freaking contagious virus. Anti vaxxers are everywheres.They want to ban books from the library such as Capitan Underpants because it is to sexual. We have the worst schools with some of the lowest stats in the whole USA. They do not like to teach evolution in school, which they have to do at this time, but they dont want to.There are a bunch of flat earthers here. Everyone wants to shoot Biden,weed is 100% illegal, even for medicinal purposes. Health insurance is an issue because they cut medicaid funds beyond belief. Now, they want to get rid of mandated HUD housing. It is a right to work state with one of the lowest minimum wages. Road rage is now an issue which is really bad because firearms can be carried without a concealed carrier permit.Everyone and then some walk around with concealed  guns. The KKK used to hold the USA's biggest get-together every year. I think they still do actually and we have the only Church in the US that does 100% faith healing.",

Yes and I have.\n\nHowever, I have relatives that have a much stricter interpretation of this, and the difference is probably based on the fact that I am a cis straight white hetero male.  There are states where some of the people that I love worry that they would get an adequate medical care if they had an emergency. There are states where people very close to me would worry about being separated from their children in an emergency.  And of course, there are dangerous regions everywhere for almost anybody at some level, but there are entire states that some of my friends who are in mixed-race marriages, considered to be completely off-limits for casual travel.

I don't really know why I'd go back other than just passing through. Most States have something of interest even if overall the State is kind of a bore, though.

Listen to commenters who visit for the NFL draft or NCAA event or conference championship. Look at the rave reviews after the Super Bowl. Everything is walkable - maybe except ironically the Indy 500 but you're tailgating that! I also speak in comparison - I work professionally in sports, and I've been to matches and things like media says all over the country. Indy matches right with the best of them. \n\nLet's say your not into sports events but like outdoors stuff. Indiana is not better than your idealistic states. But it's way better than Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, etc...\n\nLet's say you don't want to be able to travel to the various areas of the state. Indiana has highways throughout going every direction. Now maybe the roads aren't always perfect, but it's better than some states that have literally just one or two highways lol \n\nIndiana's not perfect. But it's not the worst by any means.",

            "Lots of interesting history springs from this kind of question. Kansas City, MO is the original \"Kansas City\", but it's also the original \"Kansas\". You see, the city was established in the area located near the confluence of the Kansas River and the Missouri River. The city name and the river name were inspired by the Kanza Native American tribe who had lived in the area. It was originally named just Kansas (no \"city\"). Then, the state of Kansas came along, and this required them to be differentiated somehow, so Kansas CITY it became, and it sat completely within Missouri. Meanwhile in Kansas (state), there was a major dispute about where the state capital should be located. At one point there were actually two Kansas state capitals, but depending on what side of the political divide over slavery you sat on, you recognized one or the other. For a bit more info on that see this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecompton\\_Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecompton_Constitution).",

I would describe it more as a benign obliviousness.  We just over here chillin'.\n\n2)  It's the folks who moved to California from those places who voice criticisms about those places.  Granted, I suppose that does skew the picture we have.  I must have been about 25 years old the first time I met someone who told me that his plan was to go back to his hometown (somewhere in rural Utah) after a few years in order to start a family.  I was all \"dude, you are the first person I have *ever* heard say that!\"  I was astounded.  It was an eye-opener.\n\n3)  ever heard of Bakersfield?  California has its own 'flyover/drive-thru' country, and a whole lot of it.  Folks in the fancier parts of California talk about those places the way that folks in Nebraska or South Carolina *think* they're being talked about (refer back to thing 1).

We weren\u2019t merely broke, we were selling our plasma for weed money poor\u2026but we were wealthy when it came to tenacity. Friends I\u2019m here to tell you that boners find a way, and our way that weekend was to declare the State of Washington an official Do Illegal Shit state. You see as long as we stated it verbally ahead of time and really committed to the spirit of it, no minor crime we committed would actually count - maybe not so legally binding in the court of law, but very legally binding in the court of our semi hygienic loins. \n\nThat weekend saw an encyclopedic menagerie of unspeakably harmless petty crimes unleashed upon Aberdeen like an old world plague of hot farts - nobody *actually* got hurt but the experience wasn\u2019t entirely pleasant for the People of Washington. We paid for nothing at all and it just felt *right*.  Sexual relations with another person or object had not occurred but despite that relative disappointment I believe I can speak for Dog Nuts when I say that we got the fuck down in Washington. He was my Nino Brown, I was his Pookie before the crack pipe scene, and this weekend was our New Jack Shitty. We even pulled a Sunday caper on our way out of The Moistest State, a love ballad of sorts, the kind of sweetly saccharine tune two wide eyed young men with the entire world ahead of them might sing softly to their absolutely zooted sweetheart on the final night of senior year as a teary consolation prize for losing at this game show we call teenage life.\n\n30 years later, my absolutely zooted sweetheart is Washington state, and as long as I never step foot into her again I am sure that teenage me will be just fine.

So the \u201cor other Crime\u201d part, while it could be interpreted expansively, often isn't exercised. Felony basically means a crime for which the maximum penalty is at least a year in jail.\n\nIf you steal a TV at the Walmart in Sayre, Pennsylvania and you're caught in Waverly, NY, even if it may not exceed the limit for being a felony, you will probably get extradited to PA because it's like a 5-minute drive. But if you stole that TV and got caught in Bellevue, Washington, there's a decent chance you will not be extradited. But if you travel to Pennsylvania or close to it, they probably will.\n\nA lot of non-Americans don't really understand American federalism. I don't know how it works in Germany or Australia or other federal systems, but I know in Canada, their federal government has more authority in criminal law.\n\nCriminal law in the US is mostly state law, though. The Constitution explicitly says that power not granted to the federal government rests with the states and it doesn't give blanket authority for criminal law to the federal government (called general police power in case law). Federal prosecutions are like 5-10% of our criminal justice system even though they grab the most headlines. They're things that the courts think have impact across state lines or are covered under one the specific enumerated powers the Constitution grants to the federal government.",

            "The problem with the US is that every state is like its own little country up until it\u2019s not, and the rules are fairly inconsistent from state to state. If it were a really serious crime (for example, murders or bank robbery), the police in California will send a message out to other states to be on the lookout for you. You will probably be caught eventually, especially if there\u2019s a statewide manhunt for you. \n\n But like, unpaid parking tickets or even something more serious like vandalism can also result in a warrant. In those case, the police are not going to bother hunting you down (too expensive) but if you happen to fall into their laps by other means (say you get pulled over for speeding in Oregon), the Oregon police officer will see a warrant out for your arrest.  \n\nThey\u2019ll send a message to California saying they caught you, and ask if California wants to have you extradited back to their jurisdiction. From there it depends a lot on what the California police wants to do. Sometimes California will ask to have you extradited from anywhere in the country. Sometimes they\u2019ll only ask for neighboring states. Sometimes the offense is so minor they won\u2019t even bother. \n\nYMMV here but that\u2019s the basic gist of it.

If you're wanted for misdemeanor shoplifting in San Diego and you're caught in Ashland OR, then you're not getting picked up, but if that warrant was out of Shasta then you likely will be picked up.  The reverse is true with AZ, crime in NorCal is not going to get you picked up as easy as in SoCal.

Medora is a fun little town to visit. I really enjoy visiting Bismarck in the warm months. I just like walking along the river, visiting the craft breweries, visiting the Capitol, etc\u2026 \n\nI can\u2019t imagine crossing a whole state off my list.",

If they think you are high, they will get a warrant to test your bodily fluids and if they find any drug other than alcohol or cannabis, you get charged with Felony Possession by Ingestion.  If you refuse, which the police insist you cannot do, you get charged with Obstruction of Justice which is a Class 4 misdemeanor.   \nI currently live here unfortunately.   But I advise no recreational drug user to step foot in, to drive through, or enter this state in any way unless you're prepared to have your privacy violated by a local hick police department.",

I'll give Badlands and the Black Hills some credit for being scenic, but everything else about that state sucks. The landscape is stark and boring. The weather is annoyingly windy even when its nice.

The most fun I had was hiking through the black hills and I saw a guy in a Cardinal\u2019s shirt so I talked to him for like 10 minutes about baseball and St. Louis.

            "Texas.   Passed through on a road trip about ten years ago and it was apparent that the many forced \"border checkpoints\" were not only a means of enforcing a militant immigration policy but also a way to fuck with anyone not from that state. \n\n We had our vehicle dismantled and bags emptied with our possessions strewn out in the road during multiple unwarranted searches. They didn't even put the shit back, just said we were free to go after hours of harassment obviously pissed they didn't find drugs or something.\n\nWe had nothing illegal and were just traveling to national parks.  It seemed pretty apparent many counties there obviously rely nearly solely on law enforcement as a means of generating income.  \n\nNow with all the shit they are doing to restrict their citizens freedoms that state can go fuck itself into oblivion.  I hope they cede from the union.  I would gladly be in an America without them.",

It was my first time being pulled over, i never break the rules, and it scared the crap out of me. While he was trying to scare me, the lady on his intercom said my insurance was attached to the car. But it was a traumatizing experience. In this same overnight trip through the panhandle, we had an amber alert for SIX missing children, and the hotel receptionist was crappy to us for coming in at 11pm. So yeah, no more texas for me.",
            "There aren't many states that don't have incredibly liberal pockets and incredibly conservative pockets. I live in Arlington, which is just an hour above Seattle, and it's a bunch of backwater hick rednecks here. There's only a handful of towns in each state which truly feels different from living in other towns, but otherwise, no matter where you are in the states, you are either five minutes away from progressives or five minutes away from traditionalists.\n\nAs for weather, I fucking hate hot places, but weather in the States is inconsistent. You can literally suffer from heatwave in Idaho and then have it snow for a good ten minutes the next day in Idaho. Which literally happened. And still happens. But if you go up to Maine, you'll get warm rain in one town and then snow in the very next town over. The more middle northern states are where it really does stay a little consistently cold and then death by hypothermia, and then in the South, it's between hot and imminent death by dehydration for getting out of any building or car, and you're lucky if your apartment has AC.\n\nThere is also sort of an American behavior scale, but to be honest, even if people aren't a bunch of bigots, there is a HUGE amount of assholes. Get off the computer and go outside, assholes will ruin your day. Get on the computer, assholes will still ruin your day. There's pretty much zero consequences and free dopamine for acting like a complete cuckazoid bully at the moment. The dating game is also incredibly awful in the States, and it circles back to the asshole crisis. You have dudes that will hit their ladies, and you have ladies that will accuse their dudes of rape, and then vice versa. If you're gay, you're going to be bullied for being too gay or not gay enough, even though it's literally a sexuality and not a culture, but bigots will claim that it's a huge way of life, since other bigots treat it as such. If you try to date in the black community, you will be judged for literally every single little thing you do, from if you put a seatbelt on, to how many chips you grab out of a bag. If you try to date in the Mexican community, you're going to be hounded for not being Mexican enough. If you try to date in the white community, her parents are always going to roast the shit out of you for your career and if you're poor or not, and her dad will definitely threaten to shoot you, guaranteed. And if you're trying to date in the Asian community, you will face all these criticisms, especially from your girlfriend. This is not to mention how radically political people are at the moment, where despite being left leaning or right leaning, both sides are incredibly racist and biased, but come up with excuses as to how their version of racism or sexism is fine because of a past event in their life or because they believe they are part of a minority group. Rednecks have bullied people for so long that people have now taken on redneck behaviors as a defense mechanism, which baffles me.\n\nAll in all, it really doesn't matter which state you live in, unless if it's Florida, California, or Texas, due to how wild their laws and populations are. Wherever you stop, you will be shown how great the States are, and how awful the States are. There are so many good people and so many pleasant days to have in the city or the country. And there are so many assholes and god awful weather that you wish you would be kidnapped by aliens.\n\nalabama",

It was like 102 when we got there and never really cooled off until November.

I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been to those states many times, and I still can\u2019t come up with anything that is truly remarkable or unique enough to advise someone to visit. Louisiana on the other hand I can list a great many things that are remarkable and unique, and I would advise everyone to visit despite it being just as much of a shit show by the usual metrics.

            "There aren't many states that don't have incredibly liberal pockets and incredibly conservative pockets. I live in Arlington, which is just an hour above Seattle, and it's a bunch of backwater hick rednecks here. There's only a handful of towns in each state which truly feels different from living in other towns, but otherwise, no matter where you are in the states, you are either five minutes away from progressives or five minutes away from traditionalists.\n\nAs for weather, I fucking hate hot places, but weather in the States is inconsistent. You can literally suffer from heatwave in Idaho and then have it snow for a good ten minutes the next day in Idaho. Which literally happened. And still happens. But if you go up to Maine, you'll get warm rain in one town and then snow in the very next town over. The more middle northern states are where it really does stay a little consistently cold and then death by hypothermia, and then in the South, it's between hot and imminent death by dehydration for getting out of any building or car, and you're lucky if your apartment has AC.\n\nThere is also sort of an American behavior scale, but to be honest, even if people aren't a bunch of bigots, there is a HUGE amount of assholes. Get off the computer and go outside, assholes will ruin your day. Get on the computer, assholes will still ruin your day. There's pretty much zero consequences and free dopamine for acting like a complete cuckazoid bully at the moment. The dating game is also incredibly awful in the States, and it circles back to the asshole crisis. You have dudes that will hit their ladies, and you have ladies that will accuse their dudes of rape, and then vice versa. If you're gay, you're going to be bullied for being too gay or not gay enough, even though it's literally a sexuality and not a culture, but bigots will claim that it's a huge way of life, since other bigots treat it as such. If you try to date in the black community, you will be judged for literally every single little thing you do, from if you put a seatbelt on, to how many chips you grab out of a bag. If you try to date in the Mexican community, you're going to be hounded for not being Mexican enough. If you try to date in the white community, her parents are always going to roast the shit out of you for your career and if you're poor or not, and her dad will definitely threaten to shoot you, guaranteed. And if you're trying to date in the Asian community, you will face all these criticisms, especially from your girlfriend. This is not to mention how radically political people are at the moment, where despite being left leaning or right leaning, both sides are incredibly racist and biased, but come up with excuses as to how their version of racism or sexism is fine because of a past event in their life or because they believe they are part of a minority group. Rednecks have bullied people for so long that people have now taken on redneck behaviors as a defense mechanism, which baffles me.\n\nAll in all, it really doesn't matter which state you live in, unless if it's Florida, California, or Texas, due to how wild their laws and populations are. Wherever you stop, you will be shown how great the States are, and how awful the States are. There are so many good people and so many pleasant days to have in the city or the country. And there are so many assholes and god awful weather that you wish you would be kidnapped by aliens.\n\nalabama",

            "Me too. What are yours for?  Mine was for poaching. I was 18, picked up a few lizards, and was going to keep them as pets. I didn\u2019t realize I was in a state park. It was a measly $50 fine. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t pay it. I went back to college in Illinois and forgot about it. I fully intended to pay, but I was a broke college kid who just blew his wad on a spring break road trip to Arizona (high school girlfriend went to college there - and she dumped me during this trip - like, why couldn\u2019t she save me 3 days of driving?  What an asshole). Anyhoo\u2026\n\nTen years later, I got a letter saying I had an active warrant and I needed to go to Arizona to meet with a judge.  I called, explained the stupid situation, and asked if I could pay the fine to get rid of all this. My fine was now over $17,000 because there was like a $2 per day penalty and then a 20% processing fee or something. I don\u2019t exactly remember. This call was 20+ years ago. In the end, I asked what would happen if I didn\u2019t pay or show up to court. He said I\u2019d be arrested if I was ever in Arizona again. So I offered a compromise\u2026 \u201cSince I don\u2019t ever need to go to Arizona again, I\u2019ll give you $250 for my $50 fine, the $100 court fee, and $100 for processing charges. You can take the $250, clear this up, and maybe get some of my tourist dollars if I ever take the kids to see the Grand Canyon.  Or I guess I never come back because I can\u2019t afford $17k for picking up three lizards.\u201d  His response, \u201cYou best not ever come back here then.\u201d  And that\u2019s it. But guess what?  I\u2019ve been through Arizona hundreds of times!  Just in the airport though for layovers. \n\nI also mentioned this to a lawyer relative who lived in Arizona until he retired.  He claimed that for my particular offense, they\u2019ll take the warrant and fine out of the system at the 20 year mark. If that\u2019s true, I should have gotten that letter 10 years ago!  I want to know, but not enough to break the seal on this cone of silence I\u2019ve had with the state of Arizona for two decades.",

When I get the Maine trip done I'm going to try to do several of those states/provinces together.\n\nI've been to Hawaii several times but it's so commercialized that it's not really my favorite.

If you live somewhere like Wyoming or Arkansas or Alaska you can buy somewhere cheap in your early 20s but those places are not as desirable.

He never brought it back and they harassed him for months. He got calls and letters over a stupid movie (I think it was Pulp Fiction) and the late fees racked up. After the late fee hit $100, they called and basically said they\u2019d ignore all the fines if he\u2019d just return the movie. I honestly don\u2019t remember if he returned the movie or if he just ignored them. They only had his dorm phone number and his dorm address (cell phones weren\u2019t a thing yet), so he knew they couldn\u2019t do anything to him. And he was an asshole, so I\u2019m guessing he never returned it. Probably sold it for $2 at a yard sale a few years later. \n\nArizona can\u2019t see a positive outcome\u2026 Even the video store was smart enough to try to get something instead of nothing.

There are two options: A) if the bond is big enough, they might transport you themselves to collect it or B) They'll hold you for some amount of time to allow California to respond to collection. \n\nThey're not gonna bother with all the costs of sending someone back on a 500usd bond; and it's unlikely California will send someone to pick you up for something so small.

Like, a five gallon fish tank is a cruel prison when the animal had hundreds/thousands of square miles of desert to roam.

Due to some fancy driving he was able to escape feet away from a potentially deadly head on accident and our car had a scrape on the back bumper from sliding in front of the initial scammer. Same trip we're noticing how many homes are trashy pieces of junk but have nice big boats, which feels very \"I bought this with the money off my lawsuit from the scam I pulled\". Coupled with the amount of scams I've heard people in Illinois talk/brag about, the state just gives me a bad feeling.",

            "Me too. What are yours for?  Mine was for poaching. I was 18, picked up a few lizards, and was going to keep them as pets. I didn\u2019t realize I was in a state park. It was a measly $50 fine. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t pay it. I went back to college in Illinois and forgot about it. I fully intended to pay, but I was a broke college kid who just blew his wad on a spring break road trip to Arizona (high school girlfriend went to college there - and she dumped me during this trip - like, why couldn\u2019t she save me 3 days of driving?  What an asshole). Anyhoo\u2026\n\nTen years later, I got a letter saying I had an active warrant and I needed to go to Arizona to meet with a judge.  I called, explained the stupid situation, and asked if I could pay the fine to get rid of all this. My fine was now over $17,000 because there was like a $2 per day penalty and then a 20% processing fee or something. I don\u2019t exactly remember. This call was 20+ years ago. In the end, I asked what would happen if I didn\u2019t pay or show up to court. He said I\u2019d be arrested if I was ever in Arizona again. So I offered a compromise\u2026 \u201cSince I don\u2019t ever need to go to Arizona again, I\u2019ll give you $250 for my $50 fine, the $100 court fee, and $100 for processing charges. You can take the $250, clear this up, and maybe get some of my tourist dollars if I ever take the kids to see the Grand Canyon.  Or I guess I never come back because I can\u2019t afford $17k for picking up three lizards.\u201d  His response, \u201cYou best not ever come back here then.\u201d  And that\u2019s it. But guess what?  I\u2019ve been through Arizona hundreds of times!  Just in the airport though for layovers. \n\nI also mentioned this to a lawyer relative who lived in Arizona until he retired.  He claimed that for my particular offense, they\u2019ll take the warrant and fine out of the system at the 20 year mark. If that\u2019s true, I should have gotten that letter 10 years ago!  I want to know, but not enough to break the seal on this cone of silence I\u2019ve had with the state of Arizona for two decades.",

Everything is walkable - maybe except ironically the Indy 500 but you're tailgating that!

We round a hilly corner and it\u2019s a total setup. 12 dogs, squads everywhere, they had gazebos setup and all. Pull up and cop is like give me what you got and go with tickets so we did. Sober, pissed but free. Girls got the same as us weed and booze possession charges. \n\nMandatory court date no exceptions set for months out. I, now being an adult am lementing my quandary to my mom. She then just says \u201cWrite a letter and address it to the courthouse saying you\u2019re a college student and can\u2019t make the 6+hr drive to show up\u201d I\u2019m like naw that\u2019s dumb but worth a shot right? So I do. \n\nLetter comes back saying \u201cOK plead guilty of possession, pay $300 fine then $150 court fee and we\u2019re good\u201d which sounds better than showing up for sure so I go parade my unexpected win to my mom saying she was right. $450 is a lot but better than far away court right? She goes \u201cwrite them another letter saying you\u2019re a poor college student and can\u2019t pay that kind of money reasonably\u201d.

Then we\u2019re good.\u201d  I didn\u2019t need mommy to tell me to sign that shit an mail it in!! Never heard another thing after 15ish years. \n\nThe girls flew in and went to court. Cost them a fuck load of money despite one of their moms being a flight attendant. The look on one of their faces when I told them what I did was fucking priceless. \n\nOh my buddy who got the same charges as me in the passengers seat did literally nothing about it and likely had warrants for a long time.

Like, a five gallon fish tank is a cruel prison when the animal had hundreds/thousands of square miles of desert to roam.

I said the presence of individual trump loving nazis in a state is not equivalent to a pattern of state discrimination and racism on a civic level.\n\n> However, the Nazi and KKK hub of Glendale, California, had Sundown Laws that existed then. So according to the dumbass logic expressed in this thread, that makes all of California a KKK & Nazi safe haven. Burbank and South Pasadena are the same except South Pasadena just got rid of their Sundown Laws in 2022.\n\nThere is no such thing as sundown laws you idiot. None of this is remotely true other than the fact that those cities have a racist past.  None of them ever had \u201csundown laws\u201d nor were they repealed in 2022. Sundown towns are informal. They don\u2019t have laws saying \u201clol no blacks\u201d which would obviously be struck down as unconstitutional \n\n>I'm just pointing out the rampant Liberal hypocrisy.\n\nNo, you\u2019re here to conflate a state steeped in racism and discrimination such that 15% of its counties had to be court ordered to allow black people into public housing on an equivalent level with\u2026a state that has racist people in it. Racism exists everywhere. Elected officials fighting the government so that you can keep refusing to allow black people into public housing doesn\u2019t. \n\n>If California is so inclusive then why does it have such a big segregation problem?\n\nWhat a crock of shit here on multiple levels. Firstly, you are using an article about \u201cmost segregated cities over 200,000 people\u201d to draw a conclusion not supported by the evidence. Did you consider that there are\u2026cities under 200,000 people that may be super segregated? Or entire states even? Why don\u2019t we simply google \u201cmost segregated states\u201d.\n\nhttps://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-the-most-and-least-racial-progress/18428#rankings-integration\n\nWow that was easy. Turns out California is in the top 25%!\n\nOf course no state has perfect racial equality and there is segregation in every area of the country. But again, there is a nazi size gulf between \u201ca lot more white people live on this side of town and a lot more black people live on this side of town\u201d vs \u201c15% of our counties wouldn\u2019t even allow a black person in public housing\u201d.\n\nThere is so many fallacies in this paragraph it\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019re aware that \u201cintegration\u201d is also not the opposite of racism, right? Like they are distinct concepts. You can have racist policies in an area of high or low segregation. The concepts are connected in some ways but uhhh distinct. Like you\u2019re probably aware of that famous picture of that newly integrated school protesting that black girl trying to go inside? The fact that people coexist in the same physical space doesn\u2019t imply a lack of racial tensions or a lack of racist policies. The opposite is also true. The fact that ethnic enclaves exist does not then imply guaranteed racial tensions and racist laws or policies.\n\n\n>Also, it's always the white Liberals trying to tell me, a POC, how to feel about racism.\n\nOh I\u2019m glad you got in touch with your roots since you were white in this post three months ago.\n\n>**Not always. I'm white and I worked at an Arab owned corner store in the ghetto once. An older black man asked me where I was from so I answered by telling him what town I'm from. He asked, \"ok, but where are your parents from?\" I replied, \"...Kentucky.\"\nSo he asked one more time, \"ok, but what country is your family originally from?\" I answered, \"They probably came over here from Europe a few hundred years ago... England and Spain, mostly.\" This guy didn't want to believe that I was just plain ass vanilla white lmao**\n\nNobody is trying to tell you anything. They posted dunking on racists and you rushed to their defense and bashed your keyboard against your ass to produce these masterful and logically sound posts. Nobody reached out to you to ask how you feel about it, and judging by the downvotes they would prefer to interact with you as little as possible.\n\n>CA is one of the most diverse nations in the nation\n\nAnd finally just loling at this."

It looks like how nature intended us to live.\n\nBut then we got all these humans who decided to tell other humans how they should behave and what rules they should follow. Humans decided to draw lines between each other and make more rules telling each other what to do.\n\nSome of the rules were okay because they helped the humans remember that we were all living in nature together and to be nice to each other. Some of the rules are not okay because they try to control other humans' beliefs, money-or ability to make money, religious practices, etc.\n\nSo I'm rambling, as an old lady tends to do. The point is, everywhere you go in the US, there's going to be someone who claims it's the worst place to be.\n\nOhio has a lot of political leaders and people with money who control those leaders who really need to get their heads out of an ancient book that may or may not be inspired by spiritual beings.

If you live somewhere like Wyoming or Arkansas or Alaska you can buy somewhere cheap in your early 20s but those places are not as desirable. In my experience with Hawaii where they get you is every day prices. Gas is 2-3 dollars more than mainland, good luck on jewelry there, foods are different where you are as well, parking gets expensive fast. I call the every day prices in Hawaii the Hawaii tax.",

We have a single system that can somewhat redistribute some of the wealth from a place like New York or California to Mississippi or Alabama and keep at least some minimal standard of living going. Without the Army and NASA in Huntsville, and without UAB in Birmingham, Alabama would be a third world nation (durr durr it already is durr) \n\nContrast this to a place like Europe where it is very tough (or, was at the time) for the EU to make transfers from rich countries like Germany to Greece and Greece went bankrupt\n\nYou need the poorer parts of the country to keep up, and these transfers are how that happen",
            "So the largest city in the state with the largest population has a segregation problem. New York and Chicago are higher up on the list. You gonna rail on about how those states are more racist than CA? \n\nAlso that segregation is do to classism developed through generations of systemic racism. That's the true problem behind all of this. The segregation is due to systemic disenfranchisement making it so POC couldn't develop the same generational wealth thus they couldn't afford to buy homes in the much richer parts of the city. Its fucked up, buts that's a national/federal problem and not an individual city saying \"we will kill you if you are here after sundown.\"\n\n But yeah let's keep rallying behind the oh so popular conservative deflection of \"CA is more racist!\" By your logic I can claim my city isn't racist cause Oprah lives in one of the neighborhoods, along with many other noteable POC.\n\nLink me those \"sundown laws of Pasadena\".\n\nYou sound much more like a right leaning libertarian conservative. You sure are hitting on all of the popular conservative talking points. You sound far and away from a left leaning anarchist. Perpetuating this race war bullshit and ignoring that \"the man\" is the one true problem lording over all of this. \"Pointing out the rampant liberal hypocrisy\". Conservatives love to use this argument to try and make a point about how they are not racist. \n\nYou know why those segregated metro areas are the way they are? Because the conservative areas drive them away with their good ol' southern hospitality. They know that while they might end up having to rent in a shittier part of town, at least they are far less likely to be the victim of hate crimes. I got plenty of \"we don't like your kind in these parts\" from people in Texas when they heard I was from California. I was refused service at liquor stores and gas stations in Austin for having an out of state ID. This was in downtown Austin proper. The most liberal city in Austin, and they don't even want to do business with a white dude from California. The amount of businesses that I saw with signs posted saying \"passports not accepted\" was staggering. And that's the best that Austin has to offer. But keep on defending that shit dude. I'm sure you will get your gold star sometime soon."

            "> Again, Presentism, judging a modern set of people for actions taken well in that people's past. Your argument is invalid.\n\nIt seems you have comprehension issues. Black people understood racism long, long before it was called racism. It doesn't matter that Mormons didn't see anything wrong with it back then. **Black people knew it was wrong - and we were the ones who were the victims of it.**\n\nYour complaint of 'presentism' is invalid, as it implies that there was some kind of general agreement that Mormon support of slavery was acceptable. Guess what - victims of racism were aware of it and didn't like it in the 1600s, 1700s, 1800s, and 1900s. Still not good in the 2000s. We black people reject your fake argument that 'it was OK then', just because it was more common.\n\n**It was not.**\n\nWife-beating was very common in the past too, would you argue that was 'OK', just because it happened a lot? And what about women of the past who would have had a lot to say about domestic violence being wrong?\n\n> Yea it's so bad translation services are offered at church and and they're welcomed from any country with open arms. the horror!\n\nStraw man. I never claimed or argued that LDS is a white-only church. My point is that it was built on a foundation of racism and its early leaders promoted slavery. Until 1978, Mormons asserted that the God cursed black people, and they must be forever slaves.\n\nWe understand that you are forced to defend your religion. But you are trying to defend the indefensible.\n\n> You mean like the Jewish people claim to be the blessed people of God and all that? You're mixing up religions.\n\nNo, I mean the old Mormon scripture that claimed that white people were blessed, and black people were evil and cursed. [Stop pretending that wasn't the original teaching.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-genesis-of-a-churchs-stand-on-race/2012/02/22/gIQAQZXyfR_story.html) You're fooling nobody here.\n\nIt's well-known that the Church of Latter-Day Saints [taught totally racist doctrine about black people](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/jmormhist.41.3.22) until 1978, when the pressure of bad publicity led to a 'revelation from god' and suddenly black people were allowed to hold positions in the church when previously they had not been allowed to since they suffered from ['the curse of Ham' and 'the curse of Cain'](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Question:_How_did_the_%22curse_of_Ham%22_or_%22curse_of_Cain%22_become_associated_with_Mormonism%3F).\n\nSince you don't appear to know, I can tell you that once the LDS Church settled in Missouri, the church became wholeheartedly pro-slavery. [Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, taught that slavery of black people was Biblical.](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-oliver-cowdery-circa-9-april-1836/2)\n\nHis successor, Brigham Young, claimed to be neutral on slavery, yet on moving the Church to Utah, campaigned vigorously to legalise slavery in the Territory. Bitter that he failed, he continuously proclaimed that slavery was ordained by God, and that God would ensure that abolition of slavery would fail. So he was well aware of the arguments against slavery, yet he supported it.\n\nThis long-dead mf even promoted the enslavement of Native Americans. \n\nBrigham Young spoke for many Mormons in 1863 when he commented: \"One portion of the country wish to raise their ... black slaves and the other wish to free them, and apparently to almost worship them.... Who cares? ... [Ham will continue to be the servant of servants, as the Lord has decreed, until the curse is removed.\"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Journal_of_Discourses/Volume_10/Necessity_for_Watchfulness,_etc.)\n\nClearly, Brigham Young was on the pro-slavery side of the Civil War. You can go sit down with your BS assertion that slavery was somehow OK in Brigham Young's time. He knew black people wanted to be free. Plenty of people pointed out that slavery was wrong. Young's argument was that your God supported it, he quoted scripture to support it, and many Mormons secretly believe it still.\n\nIf they don't, then how come when they knock at my door proselytising in pairs, they can never explain to me what has changed, and why?",

So the first time when just the name \"Mexico\" became its own political entity didn't occur until the 19th century. \n\nHowever, the territory of \"New Mexico\" was settled several hundred years before that.  First in 1598 with the Onate expedition.  Most of those settlers were wiped out during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. \n\nAnother expedition set out from Mexico City to resettle New Mexico in 1692 that was led by deVargas.  The paternal side of my family was in that expedition. \n\nGranted, it's a little odd that there was a political entity called New Mexico, from the 16th century, before there was the political entity called Mexico, but it makes sense when looking at the etymology: https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/New_Mexico#Etymology",
            "The modern Mexican state was constituted in 1920. The state of New Mexico was constituted in 1912. That\u2019s what they are referring to.  \n\nAlso, Nuevo Mexico had to be reconstituted in 1692, because it was wiped out in 1680. Mexico was a Province  the Viceroyalty of New Spain until 1821 (or 1836, depending on whether you want Spanish recognition to be official), so there\u2019s an argument to be had there as well.  The real issue is that it\u2019s a complex history, so it all depends on how you define your terms.",
            "I said most. Generally when people complain about the drives they're not people from out west. They're people from like 1 or 2 states over. Out west is beautiful, don't get me wrong, but it's also not always beautiful the entire time. There are plenty of boring spots. And once the initial wonder of certain landscapes wears off, you're like \"ok this is cool but I'm a little over it and we've got 400 more miles of this\".\n\nDriving out wast was one of my favorite parts of driving around the country. But there were spots where I wished I wasn't driving through 5 Ohio's worth of mileage.\n\nBut regardless, people also talk about the complete lack of any civilization when driving through certain states, and idk where they get the idea that it's not like that everywhere outside of cities. I was driving through places in Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas where there would be warnings about how the next exit isn't for 50, 75, 100 miles. You don't even see that in rural Ohio.\n\nBut yea. Some places have more natural beauty than others. Washington was probably my favorite.",

We were there last summer for the national parks. The weather should be great for you in April.\n\nOregon is stunning; I'd actually like to go back there one day because we didn't have time to drive down to Crater Lake.\n\nWe've passed through Delaware, but didn't stop for anything. And I've been to West Virginia when I was a kid for soccer tournaments, but my wife and I will go there to see the New River Gorge at some point.",

            "Please provide a link to your referenced sources, the so called \"official documents\".  Your map goes to the Archive of the Indies in Seville and is titled, \"Mapa del virreinato de Nueva Espa\u00f1a, comprendido entre los paralelos 14\u00ba y 28\u00ba\" which loosley translates to Map of New Spain between the 14th and 28th parallels and that map doesn't list a political entity known as the \"Kingdom of Mexico\".\n\nI cited an online Encyclopedia given it was easier to provide. If you need more academic sources how about:\n\nDiel, L. B. (2016). The codex mexicanus: Time, religion, history, and health in sixteenth-century New Spain.\u00a0*The Americas,\u00a073*(4), 427-458\n\nEastman, S. (2010). The history of the conquest of New Spain.\u00a0*Journal of World History,\u00a021*(4), 757-759\n\nMundy, Barbara E. (2014). \u201cPlace-names in Mexico-Tenochtitlan.\u201d\u00a0*Ethnohistory*\u00a061(2):329\u2013329.\n\nTena-Colunga, Arturo. (1987). The meaning of the word M\u00e9xico. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nI concede there was a Mexico City in the 16th century, which was built on the ruins of Tenochtitlan.  But I don't believe there was a political entity, or a \"country\" named Kingdom of Mexico before the 1820s.\n\nThe following is my understanding of the political name of the land that comprises the modern day Mexico:\n\nAztec Empire (comprised of the following three Nahua city-states:  Mexica-Tenochtitlan, Tetzcoco and Tlacopan) - headed by Montezuma and conquered by Cortez on behalf of Spain.\n\nThat political entity became a Spanish subject called the \"Viceroyalty of New Spain\" headed by an appointee of the Spanish Crown.\n\nIndependence from the Spanish Crown came in 1821 when the Kingdom of Mexico was established for two years then replaced by the Republic of Mexico, then so on and so forth until the modern incarnation.\n\nAdditionally, it is somewhat offensive that you say \"gringos\" shouldn't speak about history.  I assume you mean Latin America or New Mexico history.  Even \"gringos\" can have advanced degrees and be experts in subjects to which they have no connection.  Though I do have such a connection given my families history with the Reconquest of New Mexico in the 17th century.",

            "The craziest thing about West Virginia is nobody really thinks about it other than the home to Appalachian mountain hillbillies. Some inbred sister/cousin marrying stuff always in jokes.\n\nHowever, it is a really BEAUTIFUL state! Rolling forested hills, small mountains, creeks, rivers, caves, waterfalls, etc. \n\nIf you've never been there, consider it for a weekend trip. Just stick to the tourist attractions (Seneca Rocks and Caverns - go gemstone mining, Snowshoe skiing resort, Blackwater Falls State Park, etc.) There's lots to do like whitewater rafting, boating, fishing, hiking, rock climbing, skiing, spelunking. casinos, etc.\n\nI used to live in Pennsylvania and enjoyed WV often. The state gets no love.",
            "Over the past few years, I've had to drive out to Oklahoma City from home in central Pennsylvania at least once a year, and I've made a habit of visiting northwest Arkansas and southeast Missouri on the way. The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains are gorgeous, perhaps surprisingly so. I only use the word surprisingly because both Missouri and Arkansas are frequently lumped together with the rest of the flyover states in the plains by the rest of the country. \n\nSpeaking of the Ouachita Mountains, likewise with Arkansas, they are also the reason why southeast Oklahoma is similarly gorgeous to a surprising degree. By far my favorite part of the last trip I took to and from Oklahoma City was the Talimena Scenic Drive approaching sunset, which I highly recommend to anybody who happens to be roadtripping through that general area.",

            "The relevant part of the federal Constitution is\n\n>A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.\n\nBut the state demanding extradition has to pay for it and they're not paying to extradite someone for something small. So the \u201cor other Crime\u201d part, while it could be interpreted expansively, often isn't exercised. Felony basically means a crime for which the maximum penalty is at least a year in jail.\n\nIf you steal a TV at the Walmart in Sayre, Pennsylvania and you're caught in Waverly, NY, even if it may not exceed the limit for being a felony, you will probably get extradited to PA because it's like a 5-minute drive. But if you stole that TV and got caught in Bellevue, Washington, there's a decent chance you will not be extradited. But if you travel to Pennsylvania or close to it, they probably will.\n\nA lot of non-Americans don't really understand American federalism. I don't know how it works in Germany or Australia or other federal systems, but I know in Canada, their federal government has more authority in criminal law.\n\nCriminal law in the US is mostly state law, though. The Constitution explicitly says that power not granted to the federal government rests with the states and it doesn't give blanket authority for criminal law to the federal government (called general police power in case law). Federal prosecutions are like 5-10% of our criminal justice system even though they grab the most headlines. They're things that the courts think have impact across state lines or are covered under one the specific enumerated powers the Constitution grants to the federal government.",

I love forests so to me states like Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas aren't on the top of my list of states to visit. I'd love to visit other states with deserts and other great natural scenery like Arizona and Utah, but I already see enough farmland in the part of Pennsylvania I live in. It might be nice to visit one of these states to see unique states with unique culture though. I really enjoy visiting less visited states like West Virginia. Great place to take a road trip and go hiking."

            "My best travel story is to Delaware.\n\nMy lovely, idiot, European friend bought a ticket to come visit me in NC. He flew from Boston to Charlotte. Perfect. I ask him a few days before he leaves, what time does he need to be at the airport and this dude drops that his return flight is out of NEW YORK CITY. I asked him how he planned on getting there and he thought I could \"just drop him off.\" He insisted he knew that was like, 12 hours away but I don't believe him for a second. I think he looked at a map and thought they were close enough.\n\nSo anyway, our only financially feasible option was to take a public bus. Which in his German mind, was totally fine. But I knew it was about to be bad. We get on a 14 hour bus ride to NYC owned by a Chinese bussing company that had no toilet. We rode that thing to Delaware until this one lady went up to the driver and said, \"IF YOU DON'T STOP THIS BUS NOW, IMMA DROP MY PANTS AND SHIT HERE AT YOUR FEET!\" \n\nSo we stopped in Delaware to use the restroom. My friend and I bought all the air fresheners at the stop and distributed them to passengers because of how bad the bus smelled, which turned out to be a horrible idea. We should have bought all of just one scent, not a mix. Because then it smelled like sweaty people, farts, cherry, lemon and pine. \n\nWe were all glad to get off that thing. And my friend learned all about the American transportation system and a hard lesson in how big this country ACTUALLY is. Thank you, Delaware for a great pee."
