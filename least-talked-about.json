Which if you know anything about math means that TPTB could not possibly imagine more than 50 states, and there is another little flaw you seemed to have missed in civics; constitutional conventions.\n\nYep, that is right.  We can CHANGE the fucking constitution towards a more direct democracy with far better guarantees than we now have and far better representation.  But of course only some fascist Nazi would like to maintain the current grossly unequal democracy and representation in the congress.  One in which the person in Wyoming has twice the power in the US house as a person in California and 80 times the power in the senate per capita.  \n\nS again what kind of asshole question?

The Lakota (also known as Sioux) arrived from Minnesota in the 18th century and drove out the other tribes, who moved west.\\[11\\]\\[12\\] They claimed the land, which they called \u021ee S\u00e1pa (Black Mountains).

            "My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead- murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was\u2026 astounded. I\u2026 I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time \u2013 something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange \u2013 uh, I guess\u2026 I guess you call it a \"hit\" \u2013 on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in \"Blood Money.\"] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",

Kinda like budget Colorado with a cultural heritage. \n\nBut it was hilarious when a TSA agent wanted to see my passport in conjunction with my state DL when I was flying back. Was like \"Do. . . do you think New Mexico is a different country?\"\n\nEven funnier was when I went to share this story at a party thinking it would get a lot of laughs.

Was there for 4.5 years before heading north to Ohio. 30 years later, and I'm still in the US. NM was the perfect starting spot for someone from Scotland, such a huge cultural and environmental difference. I'm now in the Pacific NW, more of a Scottish climate, but I take any opportunity to head down to NM. I'm also lucky as the local grocery stores have been getting hatch green chile in bulk around October in for the past 5 years. What's even better is that one of them also brings in a propane fired tumble roaster. It costs a shit ton more than down in NM, but I can stock the freezer every October.",

Northern Indiana people might have a midwest/Northern accent, like Michigan. Southern Indiana people typically have a Midwestern or straight up Southern twang to their voice. I have a Southern twang, but I also moved further down south lol. It's mostly a red state, but I think it's about half divided, conservative vs liberal, however a lot of people are moderate. Everyone is mostly very nice and welcoming, Indiana considers itself Midwestern, where I grew up was extremely Southern, and holds onto that hospitality.\n\nVery low cost of living and housing. The school system I was in was great, most schools around me were. I grew up in a small town. Indiana is pretty fkin boring, not gonna lie.

Sure, we have rows and rows of corn just like most other fly over states, but as far as manufacturing goes we are definitely slept on. If you or your grandma ever needed a new hip, you'd notice if Indiana disappeared. Same goes if grandma wants to buy an RV and go cross country. \n\nWe don't really have mountains, but we have a loooot of lakes. Like, can't drive a few miles in one direction without hitting a lake. Oprah used to have a summer home here on Lake Wawasee, our largest natural lake. It's kind of crazy having a lake so big you can't hardly see the other side, it's like having a great lake in your backyard. \n\nIt's a red state with a lot of blue around it. There are confederate flags flown in yards and on pickup trucks, even though we were a union state. Kind of embarrassing. Mike Pence was our governor and then became your VP. Sorry about that. Feel free to Google his past policies and decisions, won't dig into that here. \n\nWe have a midwestern accent. It's the most tame accent you can imagine, with an \"Ope\" blurted out when you bump into someone or mess up. Parks and Rec is set in Indiana. Pretty solid show.\n\nOh, we also had a county that was the meth capital of the world for awhile. Guess maybe that goes hand in hand with the whole manufacturing capital thing. \n\nIf you ever decide to visit Indiana, I recommend checking out the Salamonie Reservoir.

In fact, I excelled at civics and this is where you tell me it is impossible to combine states under the current constitution.  \n\nYeah there are a LOT of things wrong with the anachronistic constitution the framers wrote, a few really good ideas but utterly lacking in imagination such as the fact that manifest destiny came along in the 1800's, in the 1700's they had not yet envisioned anything even remotely like a highly industrialized urban nation of a third of a billion people, shit they did not even imagine a nation without slavery because the only reason for a bicameral government was an upper house they called the senate that would have veto power over the house of reps along the lines of a house of lords and that was only because the slave states would not agree to form a union without such.  \n\nBut, the senate has outlived it's usefulness and if you look the constitution it also says that the number of seats in the house will be never more than maximum 435 (since the reapportionment Act of 1929 except a temporary increase to 437 at the admission of Alaska and Hawaii) and senate 100.  Which if you know anything about math means that TPTB could not possibly imagine more than 50 states, and there is another little flaw you seemed to have missed in civics; constitutional conventions.\n\nYep, that is right.  We can CHANGE the fucking constitution towards a more direct democracy with far better guarantees than we now have and far better representation.  But of course only some fascist Nazi would like to maintain the current grossly unequal democracy and representation in the congress.  One in which the person in Wyoming has twice the power in the US house as a person in California and 80 times the power in the senate per capita.  \n\nS again what kind of asshole question?  MAGA of course.",

(Growing up, I didn't think of the Territories being much different than the Provinces - just further north, colder, and less populated.)

            "Idaho. It's not often lumped in with it's coasty neighbors, and it's not a plains state, and about the only time it's brought up is when someone wants to talk about a place to get away with murder. It's politics is to the right of many southern states, and it competes with them in categories like education funding, drug overdose, and poverty ... it's like an honorary southern state. And, there's not much *in it* to go see. You see the mountains and wilderness in *either* Montana, Washington, or Oregon--or you go straight to Nevada.   \n\n\nIt *may* sometimes come up when one of their elected people does something truly batshit insane--like their Lt governor *openly supporting white nationalists*.

For sports, all 5 major team sports are represented. The cardinals and chiefs are both very good teams to root for. The state is centrally located so a flight to almost anywhere in the us is pretty short. Lake of the ozarks and Branson are really good retirement and vacation areas. Missouri is also the 18th biggest states in terms of size and population.

After Kansas (also named after the river) became a state, a group of towns on that side of the river incorporated and named themselves after Kansas City, Missouri. KCMO was a booming city at the time, and the towns in Kansas thought that copying the name would attract investors to their side of the river.\n\nThere are two cities named Kansas City.

In fact, I excelled at civics and this is where you tell me it is impossible to combine states under the current constitution.  \n\nYeah there are a LOT of things wrong with the anachronistic constitution the framers wrote, a few really good ideas but utterly lacking in imagination such as the fact that manifest destiny came along in the 1800's, in the 1700's they had not yet envisioned anything even remotely like a highly industrialized urban nation of a third of a billion people, shit they did not even imagine a nation without slavery because the only reason for a bicameral government was an upper house they called the senate that would have veto power over the house of reps along the lines of a house of lords and that was only because the slave states would not agree to form a union without such.  \n\nBut, the senate has outlived it's usefulness and if you look the constitution it also says that the number of seats in the house will be never more than maximum 435 (since the reapportionment Act of 1929 except a temporary increase to 437 at the admission of Alaska and Hawaii) and senate 100.  Which if you know anything about math means that TPTB could not possibly imagine more than 50 states, and there is another little flaw you seemed to have missed in civics; constitutional conventions.\n\nYep, that is right.  We can CHANGE the fucking constitution towards a more direct democracy with far better guarantees than we now have and far better representation.  But of course only some fascist Nazi would like to maintain the current grossly unequal democracy and representation in the congress.  One in which the person in Wyoming has twice the power in the US house as a person in California and 80 times the power in the senate per capita.  \n\nS again what kind of asshole question?

In fact, I excelled at civics and this is where you tell me it is impossible to combine states under the current constitution.  \n\nYeah there are a LOT of things wrong with the anachronistic constitution the framers wrote, a few really good ideas but utterly lacking in imagination such as the fact that manifest destiny came along in the 1800's, in the 1700's they had not yet envisioned anything even remotely like a highly industrialized urban nation of a third of a billion people, shit they did not even imagine a nation without slavery because the only reason for a bicameral government was an upper house they called the senate that would have veto power over the house of reps along the lines of a house of lords and that was only because the slave states would not agree to form a union without such.  \n\nBut, the senate has outlived it's usefulness and if you look the constitution it also says that the number of seats in the house will be never more than maximum 435 (since the reapportionment Act of 1929 except a temporary increase to 437 at the admission of Alaska and Hawaii) and senate 100.  Which if you know anything about math means that TPTB could not possibly imagine more than 50 states, and there is another little flaw you seemed to have missed in civics; constitutional conventions.\n\nYep, that is right.  We can CHANGE the fucking constitution towards a more direct democracy with far better guarantees than we now have and far better representation.  But of course only some fascist Nazi would like to maintain the current grossly unequal democracy and representation in the congress.  One in which the person in Wyoming has twice the power in the US house as a person in California and 80 times the power in the senate per capita.  \n\nS again what kind of asshole question?

Northern part of the state gets cold heavy winters, and the summer is slightly milder. There's a huge change in climate from top to bottom of the state. Northern Indiana people might have a midwest/Northern accent, like Michigan. Southern Indiana people typically have a Midwestern or straight up Southern twang to their voice. I have a Southern twang, but I also moved further down south lol. It's mostly a red state, but I think it's about half divided, conservative vs liberal, however a lot of people are moderate. Everyone is mostly very nice and welcoming, Indiana considers itself Midwestern, where I grew up was extremely Southern, and holds onto that hospitality.\n\nVery low cost of living and housing. The school system I was in was great, most schools around me were. I grew up in a small town. Indiana is pretty fkin boring, not gonna lie. And cops are bored too, I'm always careful to not go over the speed limit. I moved to a much bigger city and I'm a lot happier here.

            "Parks and Rec is set in Indiana. The northern part of the state is supremely flat - similar to central Ohio. The northwestern corner is to Chicago what Northeastern NJ is to NYC. Southern Indiana is very pretty - great fork hiking. \n\nIndianapolis used to be a top ten city population-wise, but it\u2019s tumbled down the list as populations have exploded in cities like Atlanta and Austin. Eli Lilly pharmaceuticals is a big employer there and it\u2019s also home to Rolls Royce (plane engines, not cars). \n\nThe rest of the state is heavy on farming and some manufacturing. Good state schools and Notre Dame is in South Bend, IN. \n\nSimilarly to Connecticut, Kentucky, and North Carolina, it\u2019s a rabid basketball state. The football programs of said state schools have historically been overshadowed by Notre Dame.",
