While there are certainly regions around the country with a large amount of religious influence in politics, it's not quite the same as what happens in Utah (which led to the original comment about Utah \"Blatantly ignoring separation of church and state\").\n\nAnyway, I'm not really interested in continuing this conversation... My entire point was simply that Utah fails to separate church and state, and that /u/di3sel was correct that that is an *identifying factor* of the state.

I've been through, it's nothing but corporations evading taxes and a few homes and fields. At least where I've been. \n\nDon't be sad though. The vast majority of Americans don't know where Yorkshire is, and think Ireland is part of the UK. I wouldn't be surprised if like 25% of people in the US don't know about Wales. \n\nEdit: No idea why I'm getting downvoted. I'm American. We are notoriously bad at geography, collectively.

Companies register in Delaware because Delaware has a rich and predictable body of case law describing corporate governance.  \n\nIf I wanted to create a tax haven, the first thing I would do is create a Delaware company to make the company look like every other company. The tax-avoiding shenanigans wouldn't be done in Delaware under Delaware law. They'd be done in jurisdictions that allow tax avoidance.  \n\nThe best analogy I can make is a con man who puts on a business suit to make himself look respectable. He wants to look like a regular businessman. Saying Delaware corporations are tax havens is like saying everyone in a suit is a con man. ",

It doesn't do this for a number of reasons, chief among which is that corporations in support of candidates on any side of the aisle would all be very unhappy with such a proposal. "

",
            "Indiana: Meth",
            "So I live in Kansas, and here's the list:\n\n  - Not Funding Schools.\n        * Irony Alert: Funding Schools is the only specific budgetary duty prescribed by the Kansas Constitution not just lumped into budget. Schools across the state have en masse sued the State multiple times for inadequate funding, mostly successfully, and the state court even has it's own way to see if Schools are funded \"adequately\" (Yes, that word is interpreted as perfectly ambiguous as you think it is) called the \"Gannon Test\".\n\n  - Branches of Government suing other Branches of Government\n        * That leads to our legislature being mad about being handcuffed by said constitutional requirement but not actually being mad at the constitution but at the court for interpreting it. So in 2016, the House has proceeded to begin suing the Court. However it previously sued itself over not completing drawing electoral districts (Mind you, in what is more than basically a one party government) in 2012, because without that, we couldn't have had elections.\n\n  - Presidents who you don't love/hate\n       * (1/1) Eisenhower. I mean he's not bad.\n\n  - Restricting Alcohol\n       * \"Six Tiered Alcohol Distribution System\". More complicated than it sounds. Hey I guess it's better than Prohibition, which only ended in Kansas in 1986. \n\n  - Being the legit wild west\n       * Could start with John Brown, but let's save that and say Carrie Nation, who hatcheted men in bars (Yes, \"hatcheted\"), and how about naked prostitute races from river back to the bar on SUNDAY afternoon (i.e. after church) called \"The Running of The Doves\" and had horse race style betting for the numerous onlookers. Today you can't open carry alcohol, but you can open carry guns. These aren't even rural examples (Dodge City being prime), no these occurred in the states then largest city.\n\n  - Having multiple Constitutions.\n        * Kansas has had four constitutions, the differences mainly revolve around three factors 1) Slavery, 2) How big is Kansas really?, and 3) Where is the capitol? Today's Kansas Constitution is called the Wyandotte Constitution (Where it was drafted).\n\n  - Provoking literal wars with our Neighbors\n        * People think Kansas-Missouri is a college sports rivalry, but it goes alot deeper. It stems from something called the Border War, (Called \"Bleeding Kansas\" in Kansas) where Pro-Slavery Missourians (\"Border Ruffians\") came over to mess with Kansas' political system (They even created one of the four constitutions above), and Kansan's, obviously unhappy by said meddling decided to they needed to shoot the Missourian's and formed the \"Jayhawkers\" militia led by John Brown. In 1863, The Border Ruffians led by Quantrill, conducted Quantrill's Raid and burned Lawrence, Kansas (The home of the University of Kansas) almost to the ground. \n\n  - Actually Starting Civil Wars\n         * Fort Sumter may be where the official conflict began, but the first battles of the period over the issue of Slavery occurred in Kanas.\n\n  - Losing out on Named Large Cities to Neighboring states\n        * Kansas City is anchored in Missouri, named after the Kansas River, before the state. Denver is named after James W. Denver, territorial Governor of Kansas, that's right the original post would have been Denver, Kansas.\n\n  - Basketball\n       * Just as important as Jesus in Kansas and can literally tear friendships apart. Indiana and North Carolina can object all they want but, uhhh Naismith. Also the full court press was invented at Wichita State University (Then University of Wichita). Kansas v Kansas State is a huge game where you are either one or the other, and while football is important, this win is the one that matters most. Kansas v. Wichita State is this kinda rivalry that's not, because they only ever play every so often, but mention it at Thanksgiving dinner, and Uncle Steve may not talk to you until Christmas.\n\n  - Rebuilding entire towns\n       * Oklahoma is pretty good, but Greensburg gives the edge to Kansas. Greensburg got flattened by an F-5 tornado and rebuilt with mostly sustainable green materials. It's honestly impressive.\n\n  - Getting asked about farms from other states\n       * Travel anywhere on the East or West coast and you will get a question about farms guaranteed. BTW I don't actually live on a farm, I live in an apartment in the Downtown of a city. Iowa and Nebraska may have some stake in this one too. \n\n  - Sports Atmospheres\n       * Everyone has a standing on this I believe. There is only one top league professional sports team in Kansas, MLS' Sporting Kansas City, and wow the environment is impressive. People all over the state talk about SKC and go to the games. Phog Allen Fieldhouse is a place everybody should visit before you die. Loud and Intense don't even come close to watching a KU basketball game there. Wichita State's Charles Koch Arena is incredible! I've seen opposing teams literally wilt because of the environment in this place.",

Extending south from these shores is a series of sand dunes, partially protected by a mishmash of county, state, and national parks. This area is one of the most biologically diverse *in the world*, as a result of ecosystems ranging from sand dune to meadow to swamp to wetland to forest in this small region, packed together as a result of the natural processes of nature and the convergence of several biomes on one area. Indiana had the highest proportion of protected shoreline of any other state in the US, with over *one third* of its lakeshore falling under state or federal agencies.\n\nThe Indianapolis Motor Speedway, famously home to the Indy 500 and Brickyard 400, isn't actually in Indianapolis. It actually falls in the tiny town of Speedway, IN, a small town containing the racetrack entirely within the city limits of Indianapolis. The speedway qualifies as the largest stadium in the world, capable of holding upwards of 250,000 people on race day.",

            "So I live in Kansas, and here's the list:\n\n  - Not Funding Schools.\n        * Irony Alert: Funding Schools is the only specific budgetary duty prescribed by the Kansas Constitution not just lumped into budget. Schools across the state have en masse sued the State multiple times for inadequate funding, mostly successfully, and the state court even has it's own way to see if Schools are funded \"adequately\" (Yes, that word is interpreted as perfectly ambiguous as you think it is) called the \"Gannon Test\".\n\n  - Branches of Government suing other Branches of Government\n        * That leads to our legislature being mad about being handcuffed by said constitutional requirement but not actually being mad at the constitution but at the court for interpreting it. So in 2016, the House has proceeded to begin suing the Court. However it previously sued itself over not completing drawing electoral districts (Mind you, in what is more than basically a one party government) in 2012, because without that, we couldn't have had elections.\n\n  - Presidents who you don't love/hate\n       * (1/1) Eisenhower. I mean he's not bad.\n\n  - Restricting Alcohol\n       * \"Six Tiered Alcohol Distribution System\". More complicated than it sounds. Hey I guess it's better than Prohibition, which only ended in Kansas in 1986. \n\n  - Being the legit wild west\n       * Could start with John Brown, but let's save that and say Carrie Nation, who hatcheted men in bars (Yes, \"hatcheted\"), and how about naked prostitute races from river back to the bar on SUNDAY afternoon (i.e. after church) called \"The Running of The Doves\" and had horse race style betting for the numerous onlookers. Today you can't open carry alcohol, but you can open carry guns. These aren't even rural examples (Dodge City being prime), no these occurred in the states then largest city.\n\n  - Having multiple Constitutions.\n        * Kansas has had four constitutions, the differences mainly revolve around three factors 1) Slavery, 2) How big is Kansas really?, and 3) Where is the capitol? Today's Kansas Constitution is called the Wyandotte Constitution (Where it was drafted).\n\n  - Provoking literal wars with our Neighbors\n        * People think Kansas-Missouri is a college sports rivalry, but it goes alot deeper. It stems from something called the Border War, (Called \"Bleeding Kansas\" in Kansas) where Pro-Slavery Missourians (\"Border Ruffians\") came over to mess with Kansas' political system (They even created one of the four constitutions above), and Kansan's, obviously unhappy by said meddling decided to they needed to shoot the Missourian's and formed the \"Jayhawkers\" militia led by John Brown. In 1863, The Border Ruffians led by Quantrill, conducted Quantrill's Raid and burned Lawrence, Kansas (The home of the University of Kansas) almost to the ground. \n\n  - Actually Starting Civil Wars\n         * Fort Sumter may be where the official conflict began, but the first battles of the period over the issue of Slavery occurred in Kanas.\n\n  - Losing out on Named Large Cities to Neighboring states\n        * Kansas City is anchored in Missouri, named after the Kansas River, before the state. Denver is named after James W. Denver, territorial Governor of Kansas, that's right the original post would have been Denver, Kansas.\n\n  - Basketball\n       * Just as important as Jesus in Kansas and can literally tear friendships apart. Indiana and North Carolina can object all they want but, uhhh Naismith. Also the full court press was invented at Wichita State University (Then University of Wichita). Kansas v Kansas State is a huge game where you are either one or the other, and while football is important, this win is the one that matters most. Kansas v. Wichita State is this kinda rivalry that's not, because they only ever play every so often, but mention it at Thanksgiving dinner, and Uncle Steve may not talk to you until Christmas.\n\n  - Rebuilding entire towns\n       * Oklahoma is pretty good, but Greensburg gives the edge to Kansas. Greensburg got flattened by an F-5 tornado and rebuilt with mostly sustainable green materials. It's honestly impressive.\n\n  - Getting asked about farms from other states\n       * Travel anywhere on the East or West coast and you will get a question about farms guaranteed. BTW I don't actually live on a farm, I live in an apartment in the Downtown of a city. Iowa and Nebraska may have some stake in this one too. \n\n  - Sports Atmospheres\n       * Everyone has a standing on this I believe. There is only one top league professional sports team in Kansas, MLS' Sporting Kansas City, and wow the environment is impressive. People all over the state talk about SKC and go to the games. Phog Allen Fieldhouse is a place everybody should visit before you die. Loud and Intense don't even come close to watching a KU basketball game there. Wichita State's Charles Koch Arena is incredible! I've seen opposing teams literally wilt because of the environment in this place.",

It's gross and has cooties, and we must pass as many laws as possible to make sure that it is not coming here.\n\nExample from a few years ago: Decline to re-up on tax credits for the film industry. A lot of studios were shooting major motion pictures here, including Iron Man 3. Great source of revenue and jobs for the state (crew and even cast - they did an open casting call for extras; I managed to get a spot and made $100. See? Jobs!) For some reason they declined to re-up, and now Hollywood has taken its business back to California. We were literally poised to become \"the Hollywood of the east coast\" and they fucking blew it.\n\nExample from right now: HB 2, the bathroom law. We've lost SO MUCH fucking business; companies have cancelled plans to expand here, major musicians have cancelled concerts (I know several people who work as contracted roadies for major venues who have lost a lot of work because of this) and we generally have an awful reputation, all because of this awful piece of discriminatory legislation.

A lot of studios were shooting major motion pictures here, including Iron Man 3. Great source of revenue and jobs for the state (crew and even cast - they did an open casting call for extras; I managed to get a spot and made $100. See? Jobs!) For some reason they declined to re-up, and now Hollywood has taken its business back to California. We were literally poised to become \"the Hollywood of the east coast\" and they fucking blew it.\n\nExample from right now: HB 2, the bathroom law. We've lost SO MUCH fucking business; companies have cancelled plans to expand here, major musicians have cancelled concerts (I know several people who work as contracted roadies for major venues who have lost a lot of work because of this) and we generally have an awful reputation, all because of this awful piece of discriminatory legislation.

I don't know how much of a star the Tea Party had in Kansas, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was here too.  ",

            "Driving our state into debt\n- Kansas with Sam Brownback as Governor",
            "So I live in Kansas, and here's the list:\n\n  - Not Funding Schools.\n        * Irony Alert: Funding Schools is the only specific budgetary duty prescribed by the Kansas Constitution not just lumped into budget. Schools across the state have en masse sued the State multiple times for inadequate funding, mostly successfully, and the state court even has it's own way to see if Schools are funded \"adequately\" (Yes, that word is interpreted as perfectly ambiguous as you think it is) called the \"Gannon Test\".\n\n  - Branches of Government suing other Branches of Government\n        * That leads to our legislature being mad about being handcuffed by said constitutional requirement but not actually being mad at the constitution but at the court for interpreting it. So in 2016, the House has proceeded to begin suing the Court. However it previously sued itself over not completing drawing electoral districts (Mind you, in what is more than basically a one party government) in 2012, because without that, we couldn't have had elections.\n\n  - Presidents who you don't love/hate\n       * (1/1) Eisenhower. I mean he's not bad.\n\n  - Restricting Alcohol\n       * \"Six Tiered Alcohol Distribution System\". More complicated than it sounds. Hey I guess it's better than Prohibition, which only ended in Kansas in 1986. \n\n  - Being the legit wild west\n       * Could start with John Brown, but let's save that and say Carrie Nation, who hatcheted men in bars (Yes, \"hatcheted\"), and how about naked prostitute races from river back to the bar on SUNDAY afternoon (i.e. after church) called \"The Running of The Doves\" and had horse race style betting for the numerous onlookers. Today you can't open carry alcohol, but you can open carry guns. These aren't even rural examples (Dodge City being prime), no these occurred in the states then largest city.\n\n  - Having multiple Constitutions.\n        * Kansas has had four constitutions, the differences mainly revolve around three factors 1) Slavery, 2) How big is Kansas really?, and 3) Where is the capitol? Today's Kansas Constitution is called the Wyandotte Constitution (Where it was drafted).\n\n  - Provoking literal wars with our Neighbors\n        * People think Kansas-Missouri is a college sports rivalry, but it goes alot deeper. It stems from something called the Border War, (Called \"Bleeding Kansas\" in Kansas) where Pro-Slavery Missourians (\"Border Ruffians\") came over to mess with Kansas' political system (They even created one of the four constitutions above), and Kansan's, obviously unhappy by said meddling decided to they needed to shoot the Missourian's and formed the \"Jayhawkers\" militia led by John Brown. In 1863, The Border Ruffians led by Quantrill, conducted Quantrill's Raid and burned Lawrence, Kansas (The home of the University of Kansas) almost to the ground. \n\n  - Actually Starting Civil Wars\n         * Fort Sumter may be where the official conflict began, but the first battles of the period over the issue of Slavery occurred in Kanas.\n\n  - Losing out on Named Large Cities to Neighboring states\n        * Kansas City is anchored in Missouri, named after the Kansas River, before the state. Denver is named after James W. Denver, territorial Governor of Kansas, that's right the original post would have been Denver, Kansas.\n\n  - Basketball\n       * Just as important as Jesus in Kansas and can literally tear friendships apart. Indiana and North Carolina can object all they want but, uhhh Naismith. Also the full court press was invented at Wichita State University (Then University of Wichita). Kansas v Kansas State is a huge game where you are either one or the other, and while football is important, this win is the one that matters most. Kansas v. Wichita State is this kinda rivalry that's not, because they only ever play every so often, but mention it at Thanksgiving dinner, and Uncle Steve may not talk to you until Christmas.\n\n  - Rebuilding entire towns\n       * Oklahoma is pretty good, but Greensburg gives the edge to Kansas. Greensburg got flattened by an F-5 tornado and rebuilt with mostly sustainable green materials. It's honestly impressive.\n\n  - Getting asked about farms from other states\n       * Travel anywhere on the East or West coast and you will get a question about farms guaranteed. BTW I don't actually live on a farm, I live in an apartment in the Downtown of a city. Iowa and Nebraska may have some stake in this one too. \n\n  - Sports Atmospheres\n       * Everyone has a standing on this I believe. There is only one top league professional sports team in Kansas, MLS' Sporting Kansas City, and wow the environment is impressive. People all over the state talk about SKC and go to the games. Phog Allen Fieldhouse is a place everybody should visit before you die. Loud and Intense don't even come close to watching a KU basketball game there. Wichita State's Charles Koch Arena is incredible! I've seen opposing teams literally wilt because of the environment in this place.",

            "So I live in Kansas, and here's the list:\n\n  - Not Funding Schools.\n        * Irony Alert: Funding Schools is the only specific budgetary duty prescribed by the Kansas Constitution not just lumped into budget. Schools across the state have en masse sued the State multiple times for inadequate funding, mostly successfully, and the state court even has it's own way to see if Schools are funded \"adequately\" (Yes, that word is interpreted as perfectly ambiguous as you think it is) called the \"Gannon Test\".\n\n  - Branches of Government suing other Branches of Government\n        * That leads to our legislature being mad about being handcuffed by said constitutional requirement but not actually being mad at the constitution but at the court for interpreting it. So in 2016, the House has proceeded to begin suing the Court. However it previously sued itself over not completing drawing electoral districts (Mind you, in what is more than basically a one party government) in 2012, because without that, we couldn't have had elections.\n\n  - Presidents who you don't love/hate\n       * (1/1) Eisenhower. I mean he's not bad.\n\n  - Restricting Alcohol\n       * \"Six Tiered Alcohol Distribution System\". More complicated than it sounds. Hey I guess it's better than Prohibition, which only ended in Kansas in 1986. \n\n  - Being the legit wild west\n       * Could start with John Brown, but let's save that and say Carrie Nation, who hatcheted men in bars (Yes, \"hatcheted\"), and how about naked prostitute races from river back to the bar on SUNDAY afternoon (i.e. after church) called \"The Running of The Doves\" and had horse race style betting for the numerous onlookers. Today you can't open carry alcohol, but you can open carry guns. These aren't even rural examples (Dodge City being prime), no these occurred in the states then largest city.\n\n  - Having multiple Constitutions.\n        * Kansas has had four constitutions, the differences mainly revolve around three factors 1) Slavery, 2) How big is Kansas really?, and 3) Where is the capitol? Today's Kansas Constitution is called the Wyandotte Constitution (Where it was drafted).\n\n  - Provoking literal wars with our Neighbors\n        * People think Kansas-Missouri is a college sports rivalry, but it goes alot deeper. It stems from something called the Border War, (Called \"Bleeding Kansas\" in Kansas) where Pro-Slavery Missourians (\"Border Ruffians\") came over to mess with Kansas' political system (They even created one of the four constitutions above), and Kansan's, obviously unhappy by said meddling decided to they needed to shoot the Missourian's and formed the \"Jayhawkers\" militia led by John Brown. In 1863, The Border Ruffians led by Quantrill, conducted Quantrill's Raid and burned Lawrence, Kansas (The home of the University of Kansas) almost to the ground. \n\n  - Actually Starting Civil Wars\n         * Fort Sumter may be where the official conflict began, but the first battles of the period over the issue of Slavery occurred in Kanas.\n\n  - Losing out on Named Large Cities to Neighboring states\n        * Kansas City is anchored in Missouri, named after the Kansas River, before the state. Denver is named after James W. Denver, territorial Governor of Kansas, that's right the original post would have been Denver, Kansas.\n\n  - Basketball\n       * Just as important as Jesus in Kansas and can literally tear friendships apart. Indiana and North Carolina can object all they want but, uhhh Naismith. Also the full court press was invented at Wichita State University (Then University of Wichita). Kansas v Kansas State is a huge game where you are either one or the other, and while football is important, this win is the one that matters most. Kansas v. Wichita State is this kinda rivalry that's not, because they only ever play every so often, but mention it at Thanksgiving dinner, and Uncle Steve may not talk to you until Christmas.\n\n  - Rebuilding entire towns\n       * Oklahoma is pretty good, but Greensburg gives the edge to Kansas. Greensburg got flattened by an F-5 tornado and rebuilt with mostly sustainable green materials. It's honestly impressive.\n\n  - Getting asked about farms from other states\n       * Travel anywhere on the East or West coast and you will get a question about farms guaranteed. BTW I don't actually live on a farm, I live in an apartment in the Downtown of a city. Iowa and Nebraska may have some stake in this one too. \n\n  - Sports Atmospheres\n       * Everyone has a standing on this I believe. There is only one top league professional sports team in Kansas, MLS' Sporting Kansas City, and wow the environment is impressive. People all over the state talk about SKC and go to the games. Phog Allen Fieldhouse is a place everybody should visit before you die. Loud and Intense don't even come close to watching a KU basketball game there. Wichita State's Charles Koch Arena is incredible! I've seen opposing teams literally wilt because of the environment in this place.",

If you're just looking Ivy League, Princeton is in NJ, U of Pennsylvania is in Philly, Yale is in New Haven, Columbia in NYC, etc etc.\n\nSecond, I specifically mentioned Brand Name recognition in my post for a reason.  There are plenty of fields that are cut throat that you'd be better served going to a place like the Ivy League for.  But there are plenty where it's not necessary.\n\nThird, just because you *can* go to an Ivy League school doesn't necessarily mean that you *should* go to an Ivy League school - especially for undergraduate studies.  For graduate schools, yes, go if you can.  But there are *tons* of schools that are top tier in the country that are even state schools. UCLA is rated at number 2 in the country for being a research school.  It's also rated as being number 8 in the world, ahead of a lot of Ivy League Schools. UC Berkeley is even higher.

            "So I live in Kansas, and here's the list:\n\n  - Not Funding Schools.\n        * Irony Alert: Funding Schools is the only specific budgetary duty prescribed by the Kansas Constitution not just lumped into budget. Schools across the state have en masse sued the State multiple times for inadequate funding, mostly successfully, and the state court even has it's own way to see if Schools are funded \"adequately\" (Yes, that word is interpreted as perfectly ambiguous as you think it is) called the \"Gannon Test\".\n\n  - Branches of Government suing other Branches of Government\n        * That leads to our legislature being mad about being handcuffed by said constitutional requirement but not actually being mad at the constitution but at the court for interpreting it. So in 2016, the House has proceeded to begin suing the Court. However it previously sued itself over not completing drawing electoral districts (Mind you, in what is more than basically a one party government) in 2012, because without that, we couldn't have had elections.\n\n  - Presidents who you don't love/hate\n       * (1/1) Eisenhower. I mean he's not bad.\n\n  - Restricting Alcohol\n       * \"Six Tiered Alcohol Distribution System\". More complicated than it sounds. Hey I guess it's better than Prohibition, which only ended in Kansas in 1986. \n\n  - Being the legit wild west\n       * Could start with John Brown, but let's save that and say Carrie Nation, who hatcheted men in bars (Yes, \"hatcheted\"), and how about naked prostitute races from river back to the bar on SUNDAY afternoon (i.e. after church) called \"The Running of The Doves\" and had horse race style betting for the numerous onlookers. Today you can't open carry alcohol, but you can open carry guns. These aren't even rural examples (Dodge City being prime), no these occurred in the states then largest city.\n\n  - Having multiple Constitutions.\n        * Kansas has had four constitutions, the differences mainly revolve around three factors 1) Slavery, 2) How big is Kansas really?, and 3) Where is the capitol? Today's Kansas Constitution is called the Wyandotte Constitution (Where it was drafted).\n\n  - Provoking literal wars with our Neighbors\n        * People think Kansas-Missouri is a college sports rivalry, but it goes alot deeper. It stems from something called the Border War, (Called \"Bleeding Kansas\" in Kansas) where Pro-Slavery Missourians (\"Border Ruffians\") came over to mess with Kansas' political system (They even created one of the four constitutions above), and Kansan's, obviously unhappy by said meddling decided to they needed to shoot the Missourian's and formed the \"Jayhawkers\" militia led by John Brown. In 1863, The Border Ruffians led by Quantrill, conducted Quantrill's Raid and burned Lawrence, Kansas (The home of the University of Kansas) almost to the ground. \n\n  - Actually Starting Civil Wars\n         * Fort Sumter may be where the official conflict began, but the first battles of the period over the issue of Slavery occurred in Kanas.\n\n  - Losing out on Named Large Cities to Neighboring states\n        * Kansas City is anchored in Missouri, named after the Kansas River, before the state. Denver is named after James W. Denver, territorial Governor of Kansas, that's right the original post would have been Denver, Kansas.\n\n  - Basketball\n       * Just as important as Jesus in Kansas and can literally tear friendships apart. Indiana and North Carolina can object all they want but, uhhh Naismith. Also the full court press was invented at Wichita State University (Then University of Wichita). Kansas v Kansas State is a huge game where you are either one or the other, and while football is important, this win is the one that matters most. Kansas v. Wichita State is this kinda rivalry that's not, because they only ever play every so often, but mention it at Thanksgiving dinner, and Uncle Steve may not talk to you until Christmas.\n\n  - Rebuilding entire towns\n       * Oklahoma is pretty good, but Greensburg gives the edge to Kansas. Greensburg got flattened by an F-5 tornado and rebuilt with mostly sustainable green materials. It's honestly impressive.\n\n  - Getting asked about farms from other states\n       * Travel anywhere on the East or West coast and you will get a question about farms guaranteed. BTW I don't actually live on a farm, I live in an apartment in the Downtown of a city. Iowa and Nebraska may have some stake in this one too. \n\n  - Sports Atmospheres\n       * Everyone has a standing on this I believe. There is only one top league professional sports team in Kansas, MLS' Sporting Kansas City, and wow the environment is impressive. People all over the state talk about SKC and go to the games. Phog Allen Fieldhouse is a place everybody should visit before you die. Loud and Intense don't even come close to watching a KU basketball game there. Wichita State's Charles Koch Arena is incredible! I've seen opposing teams literally wilt because of the environment in this place.",

            "Yes, however half the time it's not taxes, as in sales tax or income tax that's increased, it's the retarded fees at the dmv and other similar services. Plus, the people in southern California are a little worse off in general compared to the northern part of the state, the north has more voters and seems to like tax hikes.\n\nPlus, Jerry brown and his stupid train. That stupid train from nowhere to nowhere. I believe the first segment is planned to to from Madera to Bakersfield, something like that. Now, I don't know much about the east coast, I've only been to DC once, but imagine driving to New Jersey to get on a train that costs about 200-300 dollars a ticket. You go on this trip, nowhere near anything special, maybe you can see part of the statue of liberty or the empire state building, and you think, I'll get off here. You get out of the train, and you're back in New Jersey.\n\nI think the damn thing is costing us 8+ billion dollars, maybe double that, yet when probed about the thought of using that money for a water reservoir in southern California  (we're affected by the drought worse than the north, which gets more rain and snow, and has more water collection facilities ), him and the high speed rail authority more or less flat out refused, in that weird way politicians speak.\n\nOnce my wife and I have the money, we're jumping ship and moving elsewhere. After talking to one of her coworkers that just moved here from new York, she said overall the only major differences are that the drivers are worse and the cigarettes are cheaper."

There are tons of regulation variances for chickens, cattle, cranberries, dairy, etc. I should note, I can't stand Scott Walker, but if I am going to be objective, he has made it a lot easier for small farmers to deal with the government.

I've lived in both and currently live in minnesota. *minnesota nice* they say how about wisconsi*nice*. \n\nOne could say its preference but minnesota is \"the land of 10,000 lakes\" wisconsin actually has more lakes. The minneosta vikings have horns on their helmet *the real vikings didnt have horns*. The hunting is worse there, and so is the fishing. We have more great lake shoreline. We have better beer *what beer do you know is from minnesota*. Hell besides minneopolis what does minnesota have?\n\nBoth states are good, but claiming one as the retarded have brother was lame."
